CAPEC-649	An adversary adds a space character to the end of a file extension and takes advantage of an application that does not properly neutralize trailing special elements in file names.

CVE-2003-0350	The control for listing accessibility options in the Accessibility Utility Manager on Windows 2000 (ListView) does not properly handle Windows messages, which allows local users to execute arbitrary code via a "Shatter" style message to the Utility Manager that references a user-controlled callback function.
CWE-422	The software does not properly verify the source of a message in the Windows Messaging System while running at elevated privileges， creating an alternate channel through which an attacker can directly send a message to the product.<PlainLiteral>
CVE-2004-0816	Integer underflow in the firewall logging rules for iptables in Linux before 2.6.8 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) via a malformed IP packet.
CWE-191	The product subtracts one value from another， such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value， which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result. This can happen in signed and unsigned cases.<PlainLiteral>
CWE-665	The software does not initialize or incorrectly initializes a resource， which might leave the resource in an unexpected state when it is accessed or used. This can have security implications when the associated resource is expected to have certain properties or values， such as a variable that determines whether a user has been authenticated or not.<PlainLiteral>
CVE-2001-1471	prefs.php in phpBB 1.4.0 and earlier allows remote authenticated users to execute arbitrary PHP code via an invalid language value, which prevents the variables (1) $l_statsblock in prefs.php or (2) $l_privnotify in auth.php from being properly initialized, which can be modified by the user and later used in an eval statement.
CAPEC-613	In this attack scenario， the attacker passively listens for WiFi management frame messages containing the Service Set Identifier (SSID) for the WiFi network. These messages are frequently transmitted by WiFi access points (e.g.， the retransmission device) as well as by clients that are accessing the network (e.g.， the handset/mobile device). Once the attacker is able to associate an SSID with a particular user or set of users (for example， when attending a public event)， the attacker can then scan for this SSID to track that user in the future.<PlainLiteral>
CWE-201	The accidental exposure of sensitive information through sent data refers to the transmission of data which are either sensitive in and of itself or useful in the further exploitation of the system through standard data channels.<PlainLiteral>
CVE-2004-0230	TCP, when using a large Window Size, makes it easier for remote attackers to guess sequence numbers and cause a denial of service (connection loss) to persistent TCP connections by repeatedly injecting a TCP RST packet, especially in protocols that use long-lived connections, such as BGP.
CWE-334	The number of possible random values is smaller than needed by the product， making it more susceptible to brute force attacks.<PlainLiteral>
CVE-2019-6824	A CWE-119: Buffer Errors vulnerability exists in ProClima (all versions prior to version 8.0.0) which allows an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the targeted system in all versions of ProClima prior to version 8.0.0.

CVE-2019-11714	Necko can access a child on the wrong thread during UDP connections, resulting in a potentially exploitable crash in some instances. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 68.
CWE-20	The product does not validate or incorrectly validates input that can affect the control flow or data flow of a program. When software does not validate input properly， an attacker is able to craft the input in a form that is not expected by the rest of the application. This will lead to parts of the system receiving unintended input， which may result in altered control flow， arbitrary control of a resource， or arbitrary code execution.<PlainLiteral>
CVE-2009-0265	Internet Systems Consortium (ISC) BIND 9.6.0 and earlier does not properly check the return value from the OpenSSL EVP_VerifyFinal function, which allows remote attackers to bypass validation of the certificate chain via a malformed SSL/TLS signature, a similar vulnerability to CVE-2008-5077 and CVE-2009-0025.
CWE-295	The software does not validate， or incorrectly validates， a certificate. When a certificate is invalid or malicious， it might allow an attacker to spoof a trusted entity by using a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack. The software might connect to a malicious host while believing it is a trusted host， or the software might be deceived into accepting spoofed data that appears to originate from a trusted host.<PlainLiteral>
CAPEC-622	In this attack scenario， the attacker passively monitors electromagnetic emanations that are produced by the targeted electronic device as an unintentional side-effect of its processing. From these emanations， the attacker derives information about the data that is being processed (e.g. the attacker can recover cryptographic keys by monitoring emanations associated with cryptographic processing). This style of attack requires proximal access to the device， however attacks have been demonstrated at public conferences that work at distances of up to 10-15 feet. There have not been any significant studies to determine the maximum practical distance for such attacks. Since the attack is passive， it is nearly impossible to detect and the targeted device will continue to operate as normal after a successful attack.<PlainLiteral>

CVE-2019-1010299	The Rust Programming Language Standard Library 1.18.0 and later is affected by: CWE-200: Information Exposure. The impact is: Contents of uninitialized memory could be printed to string or to log file. The component is: Debug trait implementation for std::collections::vec_deque::Iter. The attack vector is: The program needs to invoke debug printing for iterator over an empty VecDeque. The fixed version is: 1.30.0, nightly versions after commit b85e4cc8fadaabd41da5b9645c08c68b8f89908d.
CWE-200	An information exposure is the intentional or unintentional disclosure of information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information. <PlainLiteral>
CAPEC-275	An adversary serves content whose IP address is resolved by a DNS server that the adversary controls. After initial contact by a web browser (or similar client)， the adversary changes the IP address， to which its name resolves， to an address within the target organization that is not publicly accessible. This allows the web browser to examine this internal address on behalf of the adversary. Web browsers enforce security zones based on DNS names in order to prevent cross-zone disclosure of information. In a DNS binding attack， an adversary publishes content on their own server with their own name and DNS server. The first time the target accesses the adversary's content， the adversary's name must be resolved to an IP address. The adversary's DNS server performs this resolution and provides a short Time-To-Live (TTL) in order to prevent the target from caching the value. When the target makes a subsequent request to the adversary's content， the adversary's DNS server must again be queried， but this time the DNS server returns an address internal to the target's organization that would not be accessible from an outside source. Because the same name resolves to both these IP addresses， browsers will place both IP addresses in the same security zone and allow information to flow between the addresses. The adversary can then use scripts in the content the target retrieved from the adversary in the original message to exfiltrate data from the named internal addresses. This allows adversaries to discover sensitive information about the internal network of an enterprise. If there is a trust relationship between the computer with the targeted browser and the internal machine the adversary identifies， additional attacks are possible. This attack differs from pharming attacks in that the adversary is the legitimate owner of the malicious DNS server and so does not need to compromise behavior of external DNS services.<PlainLiteral>

Some cellular encryption algorithms such as A5/1 and A5/2 (specified for GSM use) are known to be vulnerable to such attacks and commercial tools are available to execute these attacks and decrypt mobile phone conversations in real-time. Newer encryption algorithms in use by UMTS and LTE are stronger and currently believed to be less vulnerable to these types of attacks. Note， however， that an attacker with a Cellular Rogue Base Station can force the use of weak cellular encryption even by newer mobile devices.<PlainLiteral>

(First Encounter Assault and Recon), and possibly other games, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (connection refused) via a UDP packet that causes recvfrom to generate a return code that causes the listening loop to exit, as demonstrated using zero byte packets or packets between 8193 and 12280 bytes, which result in conditions that are not "Operation would block."
CWE-394	The software does not properly check when a function or operation returns a value that is legitimate for the function， but is not expected by the software.<PlainLiteral>
CAPEC-180	An attacker exploits a weakness in the configuration of access controls and is able to bypass the intended protection that these measures guard against and thereby obtain unauthorized access to the system or network. Sensitive functionality should always be protected with access controls. However configuring all but the most trivial access control systems can be very complicated and there are many opportunities for mistakes. If an attacker can learn of incorrectly configured access security settings， they may be able to exploit this in an attack. Most commonly， attackers would take advantage of controls that provided too little protection for sensitive activities in order to perform actions that should be denied to them. In some circumstances， an attacker may be able to take advantage of overly restrictive access control policies， initiating denial of services (if an application locks because it unexpectedly failed to be granted access) or causing other legitimate actions to fail due to security. The latter class of attacks， however， is usually less severe and easier to detect than attacks based on inadequate security restrictions. This attack pattern differs from CAPEC 1， 'Accessing Functionality Not Properly Constrained by ACLs' in that the latter describes attacks where sensitive functionality lacks access controls， where， in this pattern， the access control is present， but incorrectly configured.<PlainLiteral>

CVE-2005-4620	Buffer overflow in WinRAR 3.50 and earlier allows local users to execute arbitrary code via a long command-line argument.  NOTE: because this program executes with the privileges of the invoking user, and because remote programs do not normally have the ability to specify a command-line argument for this program, there may not be a typical attack vector for the issue that crosses privilege boundaries. Therefore this may not be a vulnerability.
CAPEC-200	An attacker removes or disables filtering mechanisms on the target application. Input filters prevent invalid data from being sent to an application (for example， overly large inputs that might cause a buffer overflow or other malformed inputs that may not be correctly handled by an application). Input filters might also be designed to constrained executable content. For example， if an application accepts scripting languages as input， an input filter could constrain the commands received and block those that the application's administrator deems to be overly powerful. An output filter screens responses from an application or person in order to prevent disclosure of sensitive information. For example， an application's output filter might block output that is sourced to sensitive folders or which contains certain keywords. A data mask is similar to an output filter， but usually applies to structured data， such as found in databases. Data masks elide or replace portions of the information returned from a query in order to protect against the disclosure of sensitive information. If an input filter is removed the attacker will be able to send content to the target and have the target utilize it without it being sanitized. If the content sent by the attacker is executable， the attacker may be able to execute arbitrary commands on the target. If an output filter or data masking mechanism is disabled， the target may send out sensitive information that would otherwise be elided by the filters. If the data mask is disabled， sensitive information stored in a database would be returned unaltered. This could result in the disclosure of sensitive information， such as social security numbers of payment records. This attack is usually executed as part of a larger attack series. The attacker would disable filters and would then mount additional attacks to either insert commands or data or query the target application in ways that would otherwise be prevented by the filters.<PlainLiteral>

CAPEC-50	An attacker may take advantage of the application feature to help users recover their forgotten passwords in order to gain access into the system with the same privileges as the original user. Generally password recovery schemes tend to be weak and insecure. Most of them use only one security question . For instance， mother's maiden name tends to be a fairly popular one. Unfortunately in many cases this information is not very hard to find， especially if the attacker knows the legitimate user. These generic security questions are also re-used across many applications， thus making them even more insecure. An attacker could for instance overhear a coworker talking to a bank representative at the work place and supplying their mother's maiden name for verification purposes. An attacker can then try to log in into one of the victim's accounts， click on 'forgot password' and there is a good chance that the security question there will be to provide mother's maiden name. A weak password recovery scheme totally undermines the effectiveness of a strong password scheme.<PlainLiteral>

NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third party information.
CAPEC-55	An attacker gets access to the database table where hashes of passwords are stored. He then uses a rainbow table of pre-computed hash chains to attempt to look up the original password. Once the original password corresponding to the hash is obtained， the attacker uses the original password to gain access to the system. A password rainbow table stores hash chains for various passwords. A password chain is computed， starting from the original password， P， via a reduce(compression) function R and a hash function H. A recurrence relation exists where Xi+1 = R(H(Xi))， X0 = P. Then the hash chain of length n for the original password P can be formed: X1， X2， X3， ... ， Xn-2， Xn-1， Xn， H(Xn). P and H(Xn) are then stored together in the rainbow table. Constructing the rainbow tables takes a very long time and is computationally expensive. A separate table needs to be constructed for the various hash algorithms (e.g. SHA1， MD5， etc.). However， once a rainbow table is computed， it can be very effective in cracking the passwords that have been hashed without the use of salt.<PlainLiteral>

CAPEC-140	Some web applications require users to submit information through an ordered sequence of web forms. This is often done if there is a very large amount of information being collected or if information on earlier forms is used to pre-populate fields or determine which additional information the application needs to collect. An attacker who knows the names of the various forms in the sequence may be able to explicitly type in the name of a later form and navigate to it without first going through the previous forms. This can result in incomplete collection of information， incorrect assumptions about the information submitted by the attacker， or other problems that can impair the functioning of the application.<PlainLiteral>

CVE-2012-6375	** RESERVED ** This candidate has been reserved by an organization or individual that will use it when announcing a new security problem. When the candidate has been publicized, the details for this candidate will be provided.
CWE-403	A process does not close sensitive file descriptors before invoking a child process， which allows the child to perform unauthorized I/O operations using those descriptors. When a new process is forked or executed， the child process inherits any open file descriptors. When the child process has fewer privileges than the parent process， this might introduce a vulnerability if the child process can access the file descriptor but does not have the privileges to access the associated file.<PlainLiteral>
CVE-2006-5397	The Xinput module (modules/im/ximcp/imLcIm.c) in X.Org libX11 1.0.2 and 1.0.3 opens a file for reading twice using the same file descriptor, which causes a file descriptor leak that allows local users to read files specified by the XCOMPOSEFILE environment variable via the duplicate file descriptor.
CVE-2001-1193	Directory traversal vulnerability in EFTP 2.0.8.346 allows local users to read directories via a ... (modified dot dot) in the CWD command.
CWE-23	The software uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory， but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as '..' that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory. This allows attackers to traverse the file system to access files or directories that are outside of the restricted directory.<PlainLiteral>
CVE-2019-13373	An issue was discovered in the D-Link Central WiFi Manager CWM(100) before v1.03R0100_BETA6. Input does not get validated and arbitrary SQL statements can be executed in the database via the /web/Public/Conn.php parameter dbSQL.
CWE-89	The software constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component， but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component. <PlainLiteral>
CAPEC-127	An adversary crafts a request to a target that results in the target listing/indexing the content of a directory as output. One common method of triggering directory contents as output is to construct a request containing a path that terminates in a directory name rather than a file name since many applications are configured to provide a list of the directory's contents when such a request is received. An adversary can use this to explore the directory tree on a target as well as learn the names of files. This can often end up revealing test files， backup files， temporary files， hidden files， configuration files， user accounts， script contents， as well as naming conventions， all of which can be used by an attacker to mount additional attacks.<PlainLiteral>
CWE-732	The software specifies permissions for a security-critical resource in a way that allows that resource to be read or modified by unintended actors. When a resource is given a permissions setting that provides access to a wider range of actors than required， it could lead to the exposure of sensitive information， or the modification of that resource by unintended parties. This is especially dangerous when the resource is related to program configuration， execution or sensitive user data.<PlainLiteral>
CAPEC-643	An adversary discovers connections between systems by exploiting the target system's standard practice of revealing them in searchable， common areas. Through the identification of shared folders/drives between systems， the adversary may further their goals of locating and collecting sensitive information/files， or map potential routes for lateral movement within the network.<PlainLiteral>

CVE-2002-1484	DB4Web server, when configured to use verbose debug messages, allows remote attackers to use DB4Web as a proxy and attempt TCP connections to other systems (port scan) via a request for a URL that specifies the target IP address and port, which produces a connection status in the resulting error message.
CWE-441	The software receives a request， message， or directive from an upstream component， but the software does not sufficiently preserve the original source of the request before forwarding the request to an external actor that is outside of the software's control sphere. This causes the software to appear to be the source of the request， leading it to act as a proxy or other intermediary between the upstream component and the external actor. <PlainLiteral>
CVE-2005-0587	Firefox before 1.0.1 and Mozilla before 1.7.6 allows remote malicious web sites to overwrite arbitrary files by tricking the user into downloading a .LNK (link) file twice, which overwrites the file that was referenced in the first .LNK file.
CWE-64	The software， when opening a file or directory， does not sufficiently handle when the file is a Windows shortcut (.LNK) whose target is outside of the intended control sphere. This could allow an attacker to cause the software to operate on unauthorized files. The shortcut (file with the .lnk extension) can permit an attacker to read/write a file that they originally did not have permissions to access.<PlainLiteral>

CVE-2019-0708	A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Remote Desktop Services formerly known as Terminal Services when an unauthenticated attacker connects to the target system using RDP and sends specially crafted requests, aka 'Remote Desktop Services Remote Code Execution Vulnerability'.
CAPEC-151	Identity Spoofing refers to the action of assuming (i.e.， taking on) the identity of some other entity (human or non-human) and then using that identity to accomplish a goal. An adversary may craft messages that appear to come from a different principle or use stolen / spoofed authentication credentials. Alternatively， an adversary may intercept a message from a legitimate sender and attempt to make it look like the message comes from them without changing its content. The latter form of this attack can be used to hijack credentials from legitimate users. Identity Spoofing attacks need not be limited to transmitted messages - any resource that is associated with an identity (for example， a file with a signature) can be the target of an attack where the adversary attempts to change the apparent identity. This attack differs from Content Spoofing attacks where the adversary does not wish to change the apparent identity of the message but instead wishes to change what the message says. In an Identity Spoofing attack， the adversary is attempting to change the identity of the content.<PlainLiteral>
CWE-287	When an actor claims to have a given identity， the software does not prove or insufficiently proves that the claim is correct.<PlainLiteral>
CWE-443	This weakness can be found at CWE-113.<PlainLiteral>
CVE-2017-11523	The ReadTXTImage function in coders/txt.c in ImageMagick through 6.9.9-0 and 7.x through 7.0.6-1 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite loop) via a crafted file, because the end-of-file condition is not considered.
CVE-2005-3153	login.php in myBloggie 2.1.3 beta and earlier allows remote attackers to bypass a whitelist regular expression and conduct SQL injection attacks via a username parameter with SQL after a null character, which causes the whitelist check to succeed but injects the SQL into a query string, a different vulnerability than CVE-2005-2838.  NOTE: it is possible that this is actually a bug in PHP code, in which case this should not be treated as a myBloggie vulnerability.
CWE-158	The software receives input from an upstream component， but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes NUL characters or null bytes when they are sent to a downstream component. As data is parsed， an injected NUL character or null byte may cause the software to believe the input is terminated earlier than it actually is， or otherwise cause the input to be misinterpreted. This could then be used to inject potentially dangerous input that occurs after the null byte or otherwise bypass validation routines and other protection mechanisms.<PlainLiteral>

If an attacker can manipulate the length parameter associated with an input such that it is inconsistent with the actual length of the input， this can be leveraged to cause the target application to behave in unexpected， and possibly， malicious ways. One of the possible motives for doing so is to pass in arbitrarily large input to the application. Another possible motivation is the modification of application state by including invalid data for subsequent properties of the application. Such weaknesses commonly lead to attacks such as buffer overflows and execution of arbitrary code.<PlainLiteral>

CWE-602	The software is composed of a server that relies on the client to implement a mechanism that is intended to protect the server. When the server relies on protection mechanisms placed on the client side， an attacker can modify the client-side behavior to bypass the protection mechanisms resulting in potentially unexpected interactions between the client and server. The consequences will vary， depending on what the mechanisms are trying to protect.<PlainLiteral>
CAPEC-386	An attacker manipulates either egress or ingress data from a client within an application framework in order to change the destination and/or content of links/buttons displayed to a user within API messages. Performing this attack allows the attacker to manipulate content in such a way as to produce messages or content that looks authentic but contains links/buttons that point to an attacker controlled destination. Some applications make navigation remapping more difficult to detect because the actual HREF values of images， profile elements， and links/buttons are masked. One example would be to place an image in a user's photo gallery that when clicked upon redirected the user to an off-site location. Also， traditional web vulnerabilities (such as CSRF) can be constructed with remapped buttons or links. In some cases navigation remapping can be used for Phishing attacks or even means to artificially boost the page view， user site reputation， or click-fraud.<PlainLiteral>
CVE-2019-4173	IBM Cognos Controller 10.2.0, 10.2.1, 10.3.0, 10.3.1, and 10.4.0 could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by a flaw in the HTTP OPTIONS method, aka Optionsbleed. By sending an OPTIONS HTTP request, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to read secret data from process memory and obtain sensitive information. IBM X-Force ID: 158878.

CVE-2019-6169	A vulnerability reported in Lenovo Service Bridge before version 4.1.0.1 could allow unencrypted downloads over FTP.
CWE-77	The software constructs all or part of a command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component， but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended command when it is sent to a downstream component. <PlainLiteral>
CAPEC-410	An adversary engages an individual using any combination of social engineering methods for the purpose of extracting information. Accurate contextual and environmental queues， such as knowing important information about the target company or individual can greatly increase the success of the attack and the quality of information gathered. Authentic mimicry combined with detailed knowledge increases the success of elicitation attacks.<PlainLiteral>
#1184:14	无论确定下一步采取什么行动，ISIRT成员都应尽最大能力更新信息安全事件报告，并将其添加到信息安全事态/事件数据库，同时按需要通知ISIRT管理者和其他必要人员。更新可能包括有关以下内容的更多信息：?信息安全事件是什么样的情形；?它是如何被引起的——由什么或由谁引起；?它带来或可能带来什么危害；?它对组织业务造成的影响或潜在影响；?它是否属于重大事件（根据组织预先制定的事件严重性衡量尺度）；?到目前为止它是如何被处理的。如果信息安全事件已被解决，报告应包含已经采取的防护措施的详细情况和其他任何经验教训（例如用来预防相同或类似事件再次发生的进一步防护措施）。被更新的报告应该添加到信息安全事态/事件数据库中，并通报ISIRT管理者和其他必要人员。应该强调的是，ISIRT负责妥善保管与信息安全事件相关的所有信息，以备鉴别分析和可能在法庭上作证据之用。例如一个针对IT的信息安全事件，在最初发现事件后，应该在受影响的IT系统、服务和/或网络关闭之前收集所有只会短暂存在的数据，为完整的法律取证调查作好准备。需要收集的信息包括内存、缓冲区和注册表的内容以及任何过程运行的细节，以及：?根据信息安全事件的性质，对受影响的系统、服务和/或网络进行一次完整复制，或对日志和重要文件进行一次低层备份，以备法律取证之用；?对相邻系统、服务和网络的日志（例如包括路由器和防火墙的日志）进行收集和评审；?将所有收集到的信息安全地保存在只读介质上；?进行法律取证复制时应有两人以上在场，以表明和保证所有工作都是遵照相关法律法规执行的；?用来进行法律取证复制的工具和命令的规范和说明书均应登记归档，并与原始介质一起保存。    在这一阶段如果可能的话，ISIRT成员还要负责将受影响设施（IT设施或其他设施）恢复到不易遭受相同攻击破坏的安全运行状态。
CVE-2009-0846	The asn1_decode_generaltime function in lib/krb5/asn.1/asn1_decode.c in the ASN.1 GeneralizedTime decoder in MIT Kerberos 5 (aka krb5) before 1.6.4 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via vectors involving an invalid DER encoding that triggers a free of an uninitialized pointer.

CAPEC-636	Files on various operating systems can have a complex format which allows for the storage of other data， in addition to its contents. Often this is metadata about the file， such as a cached thumbnail for an image file. Unless utilities are invoked in a particular way， this data is not visible during the normal use of the file. It is possible for an attacker to store malicious data or code using these facilities， which would be difficult to discover.<PlainLiteral>
#1211:9	威胁有多种分类方法，如:按照GB/T209842007 的威胁分类方法，可威胁分为软硬件故障、物理环境影响、无作为或操作失误、管理不到位、恶意代码、越权或濫用、网络攻击、物理攻击、泄密、篡改、抵赖11类。a)而根据威胁产生的起因、表现和后果不同，威胁也可分为:有害程序。有害程序是指插入到信息系统中的一段程序，危害系统中数据、应用程序或操作系统的保密性完整性或可用性，或影响信息系统的正常运行。危害程序包括:计算机病毒蠕虫特洛伊木马、僵尸网络、混合攻击程序.网页内嵌恶意代码和其他有害程序;b)网络攻击。网络攻击是指通过网络或其他手段，利用信息系统的配置缺陷、协议缺陷、程序缺陷或使用暴力攻击对信息系统实施攻击，并造成信息系统异常或对信息系统当前运行造成潜在危害。网络攻击包括:拒绝服务攻击、后门攻击、漏洞攻击、网络扫描窃听、网络钓鱼、干扰和其他网络攻击;c)信息破坏。信息破坏是指通过网络或其他技术手段，造成信息系统中的信息被篡改、假冒、泄露、窃取等。信息破坏包括:信息篡政，信息假冒、信息泄露、信息窃取、信息丢失及其他信息破坏;d) 信息内容攻击。信息内容攻击指利用信息网络发布、传播危害国家安全、社会稳定和公共利益、企业和个人利益的内容的攻击;e)设备设施故障。设备设施故障是指由于信息系统自身故障或外围保障设施故障，造成信息系统异常或对信息系统当前运行造成潜在危害。设备设施故障包括:软硬件自身故障、外围保障设施故障、人为破坏和其他设备设施故障;f)灾害性破坏。灾害性破坏指由于不可抗力对信息系统造成物理破坏。灾害性破坏包括:水灾、台风、地震、雷击、坍塌火灾、恐怖袭击、战争等;g)其他威胁。
CAPEC-82	XML Denial of Service (XDoS) can be applied to any technology that utilizes XML data. This is， of course， most distributed systems technology including Java， .Net， databases， and so on. XDoS is most closely associated with web services， SOAP， and Rest， because remote service requesters can post malicious XML payloads to the service provider designed to exhaust the service provider's memory， CPU， and/or disk space. The main weakness in XDoS is that the service provider generally must inspect， parse， and validate the XML messages to determine routing， workflow， security considerations， and so on. It is exactly these inspection， parsing， and validation routines that XDoS targets. There are three primary attack vectors that XDoS can navigate. First， by targeting a CPU through recursion: an attacker creates a recursive payload and sends to service provider. Second， by targeting memory through jumbo payloads. For instance， when a service provider uses DOM to parse XML， DOM creates in memory representation of XML document， but when document is very large (for example， north of 1 Gb) service provider host may exhaust memory trying to build memory objects. Third， via an XML Ping of death: attack a service provider with numerous small files that clog the system. All of the above attacks exploit the loosely coupled nature of web services， where the service provider has little to no control over the service requester and any messages the service requester sends.<PlainLiteral>

#1180:32	要确定最重要业务信息的保存周期以及对要永久保存的档案拷贝的任何要求。
CWE-825	The program dereferences a pointer that contains a location for memory that was previously valid， but is no longer valid. When a program releases memory， but it maintains a pointer to that memory， then the memory might be re-allocated at a later time. If the original pointer is accessed to read or write data， then this could cause the program to read or modify data that is in use by a different function or process. Depending on how the newly-allocated memory is used， this could lead to a denial of service， information exposure， or code execution.<PlainLiteral>
CAPEC-477	An attacker exploits the underlying complexity of a data structure that allows for both signed and unsigned content， to cause unsigned data to be processed as though it were signed data.<PlainLiteral>

CVE-2005-1880	everybuddy 0.4.3 and earlier allows local users to overwrite arbitrary files via a symlink attack on a temporary file created by a system call to wget.
CWE-59	The software attempts to access a file based on the filename， but it does not properly prevent that filename from identifying a link or shortcut that resolves to an unintended resource.<PlainLiteral>
CVE-2009-2662	The browser engine in Mozilla Firefox 3.5.x before 3.5.2 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption and application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via vectors related to the TraceRecorder::snapshot function in js/src/jstracer.cpp, and unspecified other vectors.
CVE-2008-1196	Stack-based buffer overflow in Java Web Start (javaws.exe) in Sun JDK and JRE 6 Update 4 and earlier and 5.0 Update 14 and earlier; and SDK and JRE 1.4.2_16 and earlier; allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted JNLP file.

CVE-2016-0326	IBM Rational Quality Manager (RQM) and Rational Collaborative Lifecycle Management 3.0.1.6 before iFix8, 4.x before 4.0.7 iFix11, 5.x before 5.0.2 iFix17, and 6.x before 6.0.1 ifix3 allow remote authenticated users to execute arbitrary OS commands via a crafted "HTML request."
CVE-2019-3895	An access-control flaw was found in the Octavia service when the cloud platform was deployed using Red Hat OpenStack Platform Director. An attacker could cause new amphorae to run based on any arbitrary image. This meant that a remote attacker could upload a new amphorae image and, if requested to spawn new amphorae, Octavia would then pick up the compromised image.
CWE-284	The software does not restrict or incorrectly restricts access to a resource from an unauthorized actor. <PlainLiteral>
CAPEC-3	Some APIs will strip certain leading characters from a string of parameters. An adversary can intentionally introduce leading 'ghost' characters (extra characters that don't affect the validity of the request at the API layer) that enable the input to pass the filters and therefore process the adversary's input. This occurs when the targeted API will accept input data in several syntactic forms and interpret it in the equivalent semantic way， while the filter does not take into account the full spectrum of the syntactic forms acceptable to the targeted API.<PlainLiteral>
CWE-180	The software validates input before it is canonicalized， which prevents the software from detecting data that becomes invalid after the canonicalization step. This can be used by an attacker to bypass the validation and launch attacks that expose weaknesses that would otherwise be prevented， such as injection.<PlainLiteral>
CVE-2004-0989	Multiple buffer overflows in libXML 2.6.12 and 2.6.13 (libxml2), and possibly other versions, may allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via (1) a long FTP URL that is not properly handled by the xmlNanoFTPScanURL function, (2) a long proxy URL containing FTP data that is not properly handled by the xmlNanoFTPScanProxy function, and other overflows related to manipulation of DNS length values, including (3) xmlNanoFTPConnect, (4) xmlNanoHTTPConnectHost, and (5) xmlNanoHTTPConnectHost.

CWE-311	The software does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission. The lack of proper data encryption passes up the guarantees of confidentiality， integrity， and accountability that properly implemented encryption conveys.<PlainLiteral>
CAPEC-389	An attacker manipulates either egress or ingress data from a client within an application framework in order to change the content of messages. Performing this attack allows the attacker to manipulate content in such a way as to produce messages or content that look authentic but may contain deceptive links， spam-like content， or links to the attackers' code. In general， content-spoofing within an application API can be employed to stage many different types of attacks varied based on the attackers' intent. The techniques require use of specialized software that allow the attacker to man-in-the-middle communications between the web browser and the remote system.<PlainLiteral>

CAPEC-32	An adversary embeds malicious script code in the parameters of an HTTP query string and convinces a victim to submit the HTTP request that contains the query string to a vulnerable web application. The web application then procedes to use the values parameters without properly validation them first and generates the HTML code that will be executed by the victim's browser.<PlainLiteral>
CWE-80	The software receives input from an upstream component， but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as '<'， '>'， and '&' that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages. This may allow such characters to be treated as control characters， which are executed client-side in the context of the user's session. Although this can be classified as an injection problem， the more pertinent issue is the improper conversion of such special characters to respective context-appropriate entities before displaying them to the user.<PlainLiteral>

CAPEC-7	Blind SQL Injection results from an insufficient mitigation for SQL Injection. Although suppressing database error messages are considered best practice， the suppression alone is not sufficient to prevent SQL Injection. Blind SQL Injection is a form of SQL Injection that overcomes the lack of error messages. Without the error messages that facilitate SQL Injection， the adversary constructs input strings that probe the target through simple Boolean SQL expressions. The adversary can determine if the syntax and structure of the injection was successful based on whether the query was executed or not. Applied iteratively， the adversary determines how and where the target is vulnerable to SQL Injection.<PlainLiteral>

Apple has shipped macOS 10.14.5 with an option to disable hyperthreading in applications running untrusted code in a thread through a new sysctl. Firefox now makes use of it on the main thread and any worker threads. *Note: users need to update to macOS 10.14.5 in order to take advantage of this change.*. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 60.7, Firefox < 67, and Firefox ESR < 60.7.
CWE-362	The program contains a code sequence that can run concurrently with other code， and the code sequence requires temporary， exclusive access to a shared resource， but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence that is operating concurrently. <PlainLiteral>

CAPEC-130	An adversary causes the target to allocate excessive resources to servicing the attackers' request， thereby reducing the resources available for legitimate services and degrading or denying services. Usually， this attack focuses on memory allocation， but any finite resource on the target could be the attacked， including bandwidth， processing cycles， or other resources. This attack does not attempt to force this allocation through a large number of requests (that would be Resource Depletion through Flooding) but instead uses one or a small number of requests that are carefully formatted to force the target to allocate excessive resources to service this request(s). Often this attack takes advantage of a bug in the target to cause the target to allocate resources vastly beyond what would be needed for a normal request.<PlainLiteral>
CWE-787	The software writes data past the end， or before the beginning， of the intended buffer. Typically， this can result in corruption of data， a crash， or code execution. The software may modify an index or perform pointer arithmetic that references a memory location that is outside of the boundaries of the buffer. A subsequent write operation then produces undefined or unexpected results.<PlainLiteral>

CAPEC-104	An attacker is able to cause a victim to load content into their web-browser that bypasses security zone controls and gain access to increased privileges to execute scripting code or other web objects such as unsigned ActiveX controls or applets. This is a privilege elevation attack targeted at zone-based web-browser security. In a zone-based model， pages belong to one of a set of zones corresponding to the level of privilege assigned to that page. Pages in an untrusted zone would have a lesser level of access to the system and/or be restricted in the types of executable content it was allowed to invoke. In a cross-zone scripting attack， a page that should be assigned to a less privileged zone is granted the privileges of a more trusted zone. This can be accomplished by exploiting bugs in the browser， exploiting incorrect configuration in the zone controls， through a cross-site scripting attack that causes the attackers' content to be treated as coming from a more trusted page， or by leveraging some piece of system functionality that is accessible from both the trusted and less trusted zone. This attack differs from 'Restful Privilege Escalation' in that the latter correlates to the inadequate securing of RESTful access methods (such as HTTP DELETE) on the server， while cross-zone scripting attacks the concept of security zones as implemented by a browser.<PlainLiteral>

There are an almost limitless number of ways an attacker can modify a technology when they are involved in its manufacture， as the attacker has potential inroads to the software composition， hardware design and assembly， firmware， or basic design mechanics. Additionally， manufacturing of key components is often outsourced with the final product assembled by the primary manufacturer.

CAPEC-21	Attacks on session IDs and resource IDs take advantage of the fact that some software accepts user input without verifying its authenticity. For example， a message queuing system that allows service requesters to post messages to its queue through an open channel (such as anonymous FTP)， authorization is done through checking group or role membership contained in the posted message. However， there is no proof that the message itself， the information in the message (such group or role membership)， or indeed the process that wrote the message to the queue are authentic and authorized to do so. Many server side processes are vulnerable to these attacks because the server to server communications have not been analyzed from a security perspective or the processes 'trust' other systems because they are behind a firewall. In a similar way servers that use easy to guess or spoofable schemes for representing digital identity can also be vulnerable. Such systems frequently use schemes without cryptography and digital signatures (or with broken cryptography). Session IDs may be guessed due to insufficient randomness， poor protection (passed in the clear)， lack of integrity (unsigned)， or improperly correlation with access control policy enforcement points. Exposed configuration and properties files that contain system passwords， database connection strings， and such may also give an attacker an edge to identify these identifiers. The net result is that spoofing and impersonation is possible leading to an attacker's ability to break authentication， authorization， and audit controls on the system.<PlainLiteral>

An attacker with the ability to access functionality not properly constrained by ACLs can obtain sensitive information and possibly compromise the entire application.

CAPEC-192	An adversary engages in activities to decipher and/or decode protocol information for a network or application communication protocol used for transmitting information between interconnected nodes or systems on a packet-switched data network. While this type of analysis involves the analysis of a networking protocol inherently， it does not require the presence of an actual or physical network. Although certain techniques for protocol analysis benefit from manipulating live 'on-the-wire' interactions between communicating components， static or dynamic analysis techniques applied to executables as well as to device drivers， such as network interface drivers， can also be used to reveal the function and characteristics of a communication protocol implementation. Depending upon the methods used the process may involve observing， interacting， and modifying actual communications occurring between hosts. The goal of protocol analysis is to derive the data transmission syntax， as well as to extract the meaningful content， including packet or content delimiters used by the protocol. This type of analysis is often performed on closed-specification protocols， or proprietary protocols， but is also useful for analyzing publicly available specifications to determine how particular implementations deviate from published specifications.<PlainLiteral>

CAPEC-302	An adversary uses a TCP FIN scan to determine if ports are closed on the target machine. This scan type is accomplished by sending TCP segments with the FIN bit set in the packet header. The RFC 793 expected behavior is that any TCP segment with an out-of-state Flag sent to an open port is discarded， whereas segments with out-of-state flags sent to closed ports should be handled with a RST in response. This behavior should allow the adversary to scan for closed ports by sending certain types of rule-breaking packets (out of sync or disallowed by the TCB) and detect closed ports via RST packets. In addition to its relative speed in comparison with other types of scans， the major advantage a TCP FIN Scan is its ability to scan through stateless firewall or ACL filters. Such filters are configured to block access to ports usually by preventing SYN packets， thus stopping any attempt to 'build' a connection. FIN packets， like out-of-state ACK packets， tend to pass through such devices undetected. Many operating systems， however， do not implement RFC 793 exactly and for this reason FIN scans do not work as expected against these devices. Some operating systems， like Microsoft Windows， send a RST packet in response to any out-of-sync (or malformed) TCP segments received by a listening socket (rather than dropping the packet via RFC 793)， thus preventing an attacker from distinguishing between open and closed ports. FIN scans are limited by the range of platforms against which they work. Additionally， because open ports are inferred via no responses being generated， one cannot distinguish an open port from a filtered port without further analysis. For instance， FIN scanning a system protected by a stateful firewall may indicate all ports being open. For these reasons， FIN scanning results must always be interpreted as part of a larger scanning strategy. FIN scanning is still relatively stealthy as the packets tend to blend in with the background noise on a network link. FIN scans are detected via heuristic (non-signature) based algorithms， much in the same way as other scan types are detected.<PlainLiteral>

CVE-2017-8336	An issue was discovered on Securifi Almond, Almond+, and Almond 2015 devices with firmware AL-R096. The device provides a user with the capability of adding new routes to the device. It seems that the POST parameters passed in this request to set up routes on the device can be set in such a way that would result in overflowing the stack set up and allow an attacker to control the $ra register stored on the stack. If the firmware version AL-R096 is dissected using binwalk tool, we obtain a cpio-root archive which contains the filesystem set up on the device that contains all the binaries. The binary "goahead" is the one that has the vulnerable function that recieves the values sent by the POST request. If we open this binary in IDA-pro we will notice that this follows a MIPS little endian format. The function sub_00420F38 in IDA pro is identified to be receiving the values sent in the POST request. The POST parameter "gateway" allows to overflow the stack and control the $ra register after 1546 characters. The value from this post parameter is then copied on the stack at address 0x00421348 as shown below. This allows an attacker to provide the payload of his/her choice and finally take control of the device.

CAPEC-461	When web services require callees to authenticate， they sometimes issue a token / secret to the caller that the caller is to use to sign their web service calls. In one such scheme the caller when constructing a request would concatenate all of the parameters passed to the web service with the provided authentication token and then generate a hash of the concatenated string (e.g.， MD5， SHA1， etc.). That hash then forms the signature that is passed to the web service which is used on the server side to verify the origin authenticity and integrity of the message. There is a practical attack against an authentication scheme of this nature that makes use of the hash function extension / padding weakness. Leveraging this weakness， an attacker， who does not know the secret token， is able to modify the parameters passed to the web service by generating their own call and still generate a legitimate signature hash. For instance， consider the message to be passed to the web service is M (this message includes the parameters passed to the web service concatenated with the secret token / key bytes). The message M is hashed and that hash is passed to the web service and is used for authentication. The attacker does not know M， but can see Hash (M) and Length (M). The attacker can then compute Hash (M || Padding (M) || M') for any M'. The attacker does not know the entire message M， specifically the attacker does not know the secret bytes， but that does not matter. The attacker is still able to sign their own message M' and make the called web service verify the integrity of the message without an error. Because of the iterative design of the hash function， it is possible， from only the hash of a message and its length， to compute the hash of longer messages that start with the initial message and include the padding required for the initial message to reach a multiple of 512 bits. It is important to note that the attack not limited to MD5 and will work just as well with another hash function like SHA1.<PlainLiteral>

CAPEC-114	An attacker obtains unauthorized access to an application， service or device either through knowledge of the inherent weaknesses of an authentication mechanism， or by exploiting a flaw in the authentication scheme's implementation. In such an attack an authentication mechanism is functioning but a carefully controlled sequence of events causes the mechanism to grant access to the attacker. This attack may exploit assumptions made by the target's authentication procedures， such as assumptions regarding trust relationships or assumptions regarding the generation of secret values. This attack differs from Authentication Bypass attacks in that Authentication Abuse allows the attacker to be certified as a valid user through illegitimate means， while Authentication Bypass allows the user to access protected material without ever being certified as an authenticated user. This attack does not rely on prior sessions established by successfully authenticating users， as relied upon for the 'Exploitation of Session Variables， Resource IDs and other Trusted Credentials' attack patterns.<PlainLiteral>

CWE-74	The software constructs all or part of a command， data structure， or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component， but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component. Software has certain assumptions about what constitutes data and control respectively. It is the lack of verification of these assumptions for user-controlled input that leads to injection problems. Injection problems encompass a wide variety of issues -- all mitigated in very different ways and usually attempted in order to alter the control flow of the process. For this reason， the most effective way to discuss these weaknesses is to note the distinct features which classify them as injection weaknesses. The most important issue to note is that all injection problems share one thing in common -- i.e.， they allow for the injection of control plane data into the user-controlled data plane. This means that the execution of the process may be altered by sending code in through legitimate data channels， using no other mechanism. While buffer overflows， and many other flaws， involve the use of some further issue to gain execution， injection problems need only for the data to be parsed. The most classic instantiations of this category of weakness are SQL injection and format string vulnerabilities.<PlainLiteral>

CAPEC-107	Cross Site Tracing (XST) enables an adversary to steal the victim's session cookie and possibly other authentication credentials transmitted in the header of the HTTP request when the victim's browser communicates to destination system's web server. The adversary first gets a malicious script to run in the victim's browser that induces the browser to initiate an HTTP TRACE request to the web server. If the destination web server allows HTTP TRACE requests， it will proceed to return a response to the victim's web browser that contains the original HTTP request in its body. The function of HTTP TRACE， as defined by the HTTP specification， is to echo the request that the web server receives from the client back to the client. Since the HTTP header of the original request had the victim's session cookie in it， that session cookie can now be picked off the HTTP TRACE response and sent to the adversary's malicious site. XST becomes relevant when direct access to the session cookie via the 'document.cookie' object is disabled with the use of httpOnly attribute which ensures that the cookie can be transmitted in HTTP requests but cannot be accessed in other ways. Using SSL does not protect against XST. If the system with which the victim is interacting is susceptible to XSS， an adversary can exploit that weakness directly to get his or her malicious script to issue an HTTP TRACE request to the destination system's web server. In the absence of an XSS weakness on the site with which the victim is interacting， an adversary can get the script to come from the site that he controls and get it to execute in the victim's browser (if he can trick the victim's into visiting his malicious website or clicking on the link that he supplies). However， in that case， due to the same origin policy protection mechanism in the browser， the adversary's malicious script cannot directly issue an HTTP TRACE request to the destination system's web server because the malicious script did not originate at that domain. An adversary will then need to find a way to exploit another weakness that would enable him or her to get around the same origin policy protection.<PlainLiteral>

CAPEC-165	An attacker modifies file contents or attributes (such as extensions or names) of files in a manner to cause incorrect processing by an application. Attackers use this class of attacks to cause applications to enter unstable states， overwrite or expose sensitive information， and even execute arbitrary code with the application's privileges. This class of attacks differs from attacks on configuration information (even if file-based) in that file manipulation causes the file processing to result in non-standard behaviors， such as buffer overflows or use of the incorrect interpreter. Configuration attacks rely on the application interpreting files correctly in order to insert harmful configuration information. Likewise， resource location attacks rely on controlling an application's ability to locate files， whereas File Manipulation attacks do not require the application to look in a non-default location， although the two classes of attacks are often combined.<PlainLiteral>

Magnetic Strip and RFID technologies are the most widespread because they are cost effective to deploy and more easily integrated with other electronic security measures.

CAPEC-57	This attack utilizes a REST(REpresentational State Transfer)-style applications' trust in the system resources and environment to place man in the middle once SSL is terminated. Rest applications premise is that they leverage existing infrastructure to deliver web services functionality. An example of this is a Rest application that uses HTTP Get methods and receives a HTTP response with an XML document. These Rest style web services are deployed on existing infrastructure such as Apache and IIS web servers with no SOAP stack required. Unfortunately from a security standpoint， there frequently is no interoperable identity security mechanism deployed， so Rest developers often fall back to SSL to deliver security. In large data centers， SSL is typically terminated at the edge of the network - at the firewall， load balancer， or router. Once the SSL is terminated the HTTP request is in the clear (unless developers have hashed or encrypted the values， but this is rare). The attacker can utilize a sniffer such as Wireshark to snapshot the credentials， such as username and password that are passed in the clear once SSL is terminated. Once the attacker gathers these credentials， they can submit requests to the web service provider just as authorized user do. There is not typically an authentication on the client side， beyond what is passed in the request itself so once this is compromised， then this is generally sufficient to compromise the service's authentication scheme.<PlainLiteral>

CAPEC-446	An adversary conducts supply chain attacks by the inclusion of insecure 3rd party components into a technology， product， or code-base， possibly packaging a malicious driver or component along with the product before shipping it to the consumer or acquirer. The result is a window of opportunity for exploiting the product or software until the insecure component is discovered. This supply chain threat can result in the installation of software that introduces widespread security vulnerabilities within an organization. One example could be the inclusion of an exploitable DLL (Dynamic Link Library) included within an antivirus technology. Because software often depends upon a large number of interdependent libraries and components to be present， security holes can be introduced merely by installing COTS software that comes pre-packaged with the components required for it to operate.<PlainLiteral>

CWE-67	The software constructs pathnames from user input， but it does not handle or incorrectly handles a pathname containing a Windows device name such as AUX or CON. This typically leads to denial of service or an information exposure when the application attempts to process the pathname as a regular file. Not properly handling virtual filenames (e.g. AUX， CON， PRN， COM1， LPT1) can result in different types of vulnerabilities. In some cases an attacker can request a device via injection of a virtual filename in a URL， which may cause an error that leads to a denial of service or an error page that reveals sensitive information. A software system that allows device names to bypass filtering runs the risk of an attacker injecting malicious code in a file with the name of a device.<PlainLiteral>

CAPEC-393	An attacker uses lock picking tools and techniques to bypass the locks on a building or facility. Lock picking is the use of a special set of tools to manipulate the pins within a lock. Different sets of tools are required for each type of lock. Lock picking attacks have the advantage of being non-invasive in that if performed correctly the lock will not be damaged. A standard lock pin-and-tumbler lock is secured by a set of internal pins that prevent the tumbler device from turning. Spring loaded driver pins push down on the key pins preventing rotation so that the bolt remains in a locked position.. When the correct key is inserted， the ridges on the key push the key pins up and against the driver pins， causing correct alignment which allows the lock cylinder to rotate. Most common locks， such as domestic locks in the US， can be picked using a standard 2 tools (i.e. a torsion wrench and a hook pick).<PlainLiteral>

CAPEC-387	An attacker manipulates either egress or ingress data from a client within an application framework in order to change the content of messages and thereby circumvent the expected application logic.

In general， content-spoofing within an application API can be employed to stage many different types of attacks varied based on the attackers' intent. When the goal is to spread malware， deceptive content is created such as modified links， buttons， or images， that entice users to click on those items， all of which point to a malicious URI.

#1214:9	威胁途径是指威胁源对组织或信息系统造成破坏的手段和路径。非人为的威胁途径表现为发生自然灾滩、出现恶劣的物理环境、出现软硬件故障或性能降低等;人为的威胁手段包括:主动攻击、被动攻击邻近攻击、分发攻击、误操作等。其中人为的威胁主要表现为:a)主动攻击为攻击者主动对信息系统实施攻击，导致信息或系统功能改变。常见的主动攻击包括:利用缦冲区溢出(BOF)漏洞执行代码，协议、软件、系统故障和后门，插人和利用恶意代码(如:特洛依木马、后门、病毒等) ，伪装，盗取合法建立的会话，非授权访问，越权访问，重放所截获的数据，修政数据，插人数据，拒绝服务攻击等。b)被动攻击不会导致对系统信息的篡政，而且系统操作与状态不会改变。被动攻击一般不易被发现。常见的被动攻击包括:侦察，嗅探，监听，流量分析，口令截获等。c)邻近攻击是指攻击者在地理位置上尽可能接近被攻击的网络、系统和设备，目的是修改、收集信息，或者破坏系统。这种接近可以是公开的或隐秘的，也可能是两种都有。常见的包括:偷取磁盘后又还回，偷窥屏幕信息，收集作废的打印纸，房间窃听，毁坏通信线路。d)分发攻击是指在软件和硬件的开发、生产、运输和安装阶段，攻击者恶意修政设计、配置等行为。常见的包括:利用制造商在设备上设置隐藏功能，在产品分发、安装时修改软硬件配置，在设备和系统维护升级过程中修政软硬件配置等。直接通过互联网进行远程升级维护具有较大的安全风险。c)误操作是指由于合法用户的无意行为造成了对系统的攻击，误操作并非故意要破坏信息和系统，但由于误操作经验不足、培训不足而导致一些特殊的行为发生，从而对系统造成了无意的破坏。常见的误操作包括:由于疏忽破坏了设备或数据、删除文件或数据、破坏线路、配置和操作错误、无意中使用了破坏系统命令等。威胁源对威胁客体造成破坏，有时候并不是直接的，面是通过中间若干媒介的传递，形成一条威胁路径。在风险评估工作中，调查威胁路径有利于分析各个环节威胁发生的可能性和造成的破坏。威胁路径调查要明确威胁发生的起点.威胁发生的中间点以及威胁发生的终点，并明确威胁在不同环节的特点。

CAPEC-385	An attacker hosts or joins an event or transaction within an application framework in order to change the content of messages or items that are being exchanged. Performing this attack allows the attacker to manipulate content in such a way as to produce messages or content that look authentic but may contain deceptive links， substitute one item or another， spoof an existing item and conduct a false exchange， or otherwise change the amounts or identity of what is being exchanged. The techniques require use of specialized software that allow the attacker to man-in-the-middle communications between the web browser and the remote system in order to change the content of various application elements. Often， items exchanged in game can be monetized via sales for coin， virtual dollars， etc. The purpose of the attack is for the attack to scam the victim by trapping the data packets involved the exchange and altering the integrity of the transfer process.<PlainLiteral>

CAPEC-312	An adversary engages in activity to detect the operating system or firmware version of a remote target by interrogating a device， server， or platform with a probe designed to solicit behavior that will reveal information about the operating systems or firmware in the environment. Operating System detection is possible because implementations of common protocols (Such as IP or TCP) differ in distinct ways. While the implementation differences are not sufficient to 'break' compatibility with the protocol the differences are detectable because the target will respond in unique ways to specific probing activity that breaks the semantic or logical rules of packet construction for a protocol. Different operating systems will have a unique response to the anomalous input， providing the basis to fingerprint the OS behavior. This type of OS fingerprinting can distinguish between operating system types and versions.<PlainLiteral>

CAPEC-28	In this attack pattern， the adversary leverages fuzzing to try to identify weaknesses in the system. Fuzzing is a software security and functionality testing method that feeds randomly constructed input to the system and looks for an indication that a failure in response to that input has occurred. Fuzzing treats the system as a black box and is totally free from any preconceptions or assumptions about the system. Fuzzing can help an attacker discover certain assumptions made about user input in the system. Fuzzing gives an attacker a quick way of potentially uncovering some of these assumptions despite not necessarily knowing anything about the internals of the system. These assumptions can then be turned against the system by specially crafting user input that may allow an attacker to achieve his goals.<PlainLiteral>

CAPEC-101	An attacker can use Server Side Include (SSI) Injection to send code to a web application that then gets executed by the web server. Doing so enables the attacker to achieve similar results to Cross Site Scripting， viz.， arbitrary code execution and information disclosure， albeit on a more limited scale， since the SSI directives are nowhere near as powerful as a full-fledged scripting language. Nonetheless， the attacker can conveniently gain access to sensitive files， such as password files， and execute shell commands.<PlainLiteral>

CAPEC-219	An attacker subverts an intermediate system used to process XML content and forces the intermediate to modify and/or re-route the processing of the content. XML Routing Detour Attacks are Man in the Middle type attacks. The attacker compromises or inserts an intermediate system in the processing of the XML message. For example， WS-Routing can be used to specify a series of nodes or intermediaries through which content is passed. If any of the intermediate nodes in this route are compromised by an attacker they could be used for a routing detour attack. From the compromised system the attacker is able to route the XML process to other nodes of his or her choice and modify the responses so that the normal chain of processing is unaware of the interception. This system can forward the message to an outside entity and hide the forwarding and processing from the legitimate processing systems by altering the header information.<PlainLiteral>

CVE-2017-8416	An issue was discovered on D-Link DCS-1100 and DCS-1130 devices. The device runs a custom daemon on UDP port 5978 which is called "dldps2121" and listens for broadcast packets sent on 255.255.255.255. This daemon handles custom D-Link UDP based protocol that allows D-Link mobile applications and desktop applications to discover D-Link devices on the local network. The binary processes the received UDP packets sent from any device in "main" function. One path in the function traverses towards a block of code that processing of packets which does an unbounded copy operation which allows to overflow the buffer. The custom protocol created by Dlink follows the following pattern: Packetlen, Type of packet; M=MAC address of device or broadcast; D=Device Type;C=base64 encoded command string;test=1111 We can see at address function starting at address 0x0000DBF8 handles the entire UDP packet and performs an insecure copy using strcpy function at address 0x0000DC88. This results in overflowing the stack pointer after 1060 characters and thus allows to control the PC register and results in code execution. The same form of communication can be initiated by any process including an attacker process on the mobile phone or the desktop and this allows a third-party application on the device to execute commands on the device without any authentication by sending just 1 UDP packet with custom base64 encoding.

Browser's same origin policy prevents the attacker from directly reading the server responses (in the absence of any other weaknesses)， but does not prevent the attacker from timing the responses to requests that the attacker issued cross domain. For GET requests an attacker could for instance leverage the 'img' tag in conjunction with 'onload() / onerror()' javascript events. For the POST requests， an attacker could leverage the 'iframe' element and leverage the 'onload()' event. There is nothing in the current browser security model that prevents an attacker to use these methods to time responses to the attackers' cross domain requests. The timing for these responses leaks information. For instance， if a victim has an active session with their online e-mail account， an attacker could issue search requests in the victim's mailbox. While the attacker is not able to view the responses， based on the timings of the responses， the attacker could ask yes / no questions as to the content of victim's e-mails， who the victim e-mailed， when， etc. This is but one example; There are other scenarios where an attacker could infer potentially sensitive information from cross domain requests by timing the responses while asking the right questions that leak information.<PlainLiteral>

This vulnerability can be exploited with compromised chipsets to compromise the host, or when used in combination with CVE-2019-9503, can be used remotely. In the worst case scenario, by sending specially-crafted WiFi packets, a remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.

CAPEC-308	An adversary engages in UDP scanning to gather information about UDP port status on the target system. UDP scanning methods involve sending a UDP datagram to the target port and looking for evidence that the port is closed. Open UDP ports usually do not respond to UDP datagrams as there is no stateful mechanism within the protocol that requires building or establishing a session. Responses to UDP datagrams are therefore application specific and cannot be relied upon as a method of detecting an open port. UDP scanning relies heavily upon ICMP diagnostic messages in order to determine the status of a remote port. During a UDP scan， a datagram is sent to a target port. If an 'ICMP Type 3 Port unreachable' error message is returned then the port is considered closed. Different types of ICMP messages can indicate a filtered port. UDP scanning is slower than TCP scanning. The protocol characteristics of UDP make port scanning inherently more difficult than with TCP， as well as dependent upon ICMP for accurate scanning.

CAPEC-58	Rest uses standard HTTP (Get， Put， Delete) style permissions methods， but these are not necessarily correlated generally with back end programs. Strict interpretation of HTTP get methods means that these HTTP Get services should not be used to delete information on the server， but there is no access control mechanism to back up this logic. This means that unless the services are properly ACL'd and the application's service implementation are following these guidelines then an HTTP request can easily execute a delete or update on the server side. The attacker identifies a HTTP Get URL such as http://victimsite/updateOrder， which calls out to a program to update orders on a database or other resource. The URL is not idempotent so the request can be submitted multiple times by the attacker， additionally， the attacker may be able to exploit the URL published as a Get method that actually performs updates (instead of merely retrieving data). This may result in malicious or inadvertent altering of data on the server.<PlainLiteral>

This vulnerability impacts exacqVision ESM v5.12.2 and all prior versions of ESM running on a Windows operating system. This issue does not impact any Windows Server OSs, or Linux deployments with permissions that are not inherited from the root directory. Authorized Users have ‘modify’ permission to the ESM folders, which allows a low privilege account to modify files located in these directories. An executable can be renamed and replaced by a malicious file that could connect back to a bad actor providing system level privileges. A low privileged user is not able to restart the service, but a restart of the system would trigger the execution of the malicious file. This issue affects: Exacq Technologies, Inc. exacqVision Enterprise System Manager (ESM) Version 5.12.2 and prior versions; This issue does not affect: Exacq Technologies, Inc. exacqVision Enterprise System Manager (ESM) 19.03 and above.

Ping， as commonly implemented， allows a user to test for alive hosts， measure round-trip time， and measure the percentage of packet loss. Performing this operation for a range of hosts on the network is known as a 'Ping Sweep'. While the Ping utility is useful for small-scale host discovery， it was not designed for rapid or efficient host discovery over large network blocks. Other scanning utilities have been created that make ICMP ping sweeps easier to perform. Most networks filter ingress ICMP Type 8 messages for security reasons. Various other methods of performing ping sweeps have developed as a result. It is important to recognize the key security goal of the adversary is to discover if an IP address is alive， or has a responsive host. To this end， virtually any type of ICMP message， as defined by RFC 792 is useful. An adversary can cycle through various types of ICMP messages to determine if holes exist in the firewall configuration. When ICMP ping sweeps fail to discover hosts， other protocols can be used for the same purpose， such as TCP SYN or ACK segments， UDP datagrams sent to closed ports， etc.<PlainLiteral>

CAPEC-329	An adversary uses a technique to generate an ICMP Error message (Port Unreachable， Destination Unreachable， Redirect， Source Quench， Time Exceeded， Parameter Problem) from a target and then analyze the amount of data returned or 'Quoted' from the originating request that generated the ICMP error message. For this purpose 'Port Unreachable' error messages are often used， as generating them requires the attacker to send a UDP datagram to a closed port on the target. The goal of this analysis to make inferences about the type of operating system or firmware that sent the error message in reply. This is useful for identifying unique characteristics of operating systems because the RFC-1122 expected behavior reads: 'Every ICMP error message includes the Internet header and at least the first 8 data octets of the datagram that triggered the error; more than 8 octets MAY be sent [...].' This contrasts with RFC-792 expected behavior， which limited the quoted text to 64 bits (8 octets). Given the latitude in the specification the resulting RFC-1122 stack implementations often respond with a high degree of variability in the amount of data quoted in the error message because 'older' or 'legacy' stacks may comply with the RFC-792 specification， while other stacks may choose a longer format in accordance with RFC-1122. As a general rule most operating systems or firmware will quote the first 8 bytes of the datagram triggering the error， but some IP stacks will quote more than the first 8 bytes of data.<PlainLiteral>

CVE-2002-0638	setpwnam.c in the util-linux package, as included in Red Hat Linux 7.3 and earlier, and other operating systems, does not properly lock a temporary file when modifying /etc/passwd, which may allow local users to gain privileges via a complex race condition that uses an open file descriptor in utility programs such as chfn and chsh.
CAPEC-120	The adversary utilizes a repeating of the encoding process for a set of characters (that is， character encoding a character encoding of a character) to obfuscate the payload of a particular request. This may allow the adversary to bypass filters that attempt to detect illegal characters or strings， such as those that might be used in traversal or injection attacks. Filters may be able to catch illegal encoded strings， but may not catch doubly encoded strings. For example， a dot (.)， often used in path traversal attacks and therefore often blocked by filters， could be URL encoded as %2E. However， many filters recognize this encoding and would still block the request. In a double encoding， the % in the above URL encoding would be encoded again as %25， resulting in %252E which some filters might not catch， but which could still be interpreted as a dot (.) by interpreters on the target.<PlainLiteral>
CVE-2009-1437	Stack-based buffer overflow in PortableApps CoolPlayer Portable (aka CoolPlayer+ Portable) 2.19.6 and earlier allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a long string in a malformed playlist (.m3u) file. NOTE: this may overlap CVE-2008-3408.
CAPEC-27	This attack leverages the use of symbolic links (Symlinks) in order to write to sensitive files. An attacker can create a Symlink link to a target file not otherwise accessible to her. When the privileged program tries to create a temporary file with the same name as the Symlink link， it will actually write to the target file pointed to by the attackers' Symlink link. If the attacker can insert malicious content in the temporary file she will be writing to the sensitive file by using the Symlink. The race occurs because the system checks if the temporary file exists， then creates the file. The attacker would typically create the Symlink during the interval between the check and the creation of the temporary file.<PlainLiteral>

CVE-2019-13288	In Xpdf 4.01.01, the Parser::getObj() function in Parser.cc may cause infinite recursion via a crafted file. A remote attacker can leverage this for a DoS attack. This is similar to CVE-2018-16646.
CAPEC-463	An adversary is able to efficiently decrypt data without knowing the decryption key if a target system leaks data on whether or not a padding error happened while decrypting the ciphertext. A target system that leaks this type of information becomes the padding oracle and an adversary is able to make use of that oracle to efficiently decrypt data without knowing the decryption key by issuing on average 128*b calls to the padding oracle (where b is the number of bytes in the ciphertext block). In addition to performing decryption， an adversary is also able to produce valid ciphertexts (i.e.， perform encryption) by using the padding oracle， all without knowing the encryption key. Any cryptosystem can be vulnerable to padding oracle attacks if the encrypted messages are not authenticated to ensure their validity prior to decryption， and then the information about padding error is leaked to the adversary. This attack technique may be used， for instance， to break CAPTCHA systems or decrypt/modify state information stored in client side objects (e.g.， hidden fields or cookies). This attack technique is a side-channel attack on the cryptosystem that uses a data leak from an improperly implemented decryption routine to completely subvert the cryptosystem. The one bit of information that tells the adversary whether a padding error during decryption has occurred， in whatever form it comes， is sufficient for the adversary to break the cryptosystem. That bit of information can come in a form of an explicit error message about a padding error， a returned blank page， or even the server taking longer to respond (a timing attack). This attack can be launched cross domain where an adversary is able to use cross-domain information leaks to get the bits of information from the padding oracle from a target system / service with which the victim is communicating. To do so an adversary sends a request containing ciphertext to the target system. Due to the browser's same origin policy， the adversary is not able to see the response directly， but can use cross-domain information leak techniques to still get the information needed (i.e.， information on whether or not a padding error has occurred). For instance， this can be done using 'img' tag plus the onerror()/onload() events. The adversary's JavaScript can make web browsers to load an image on the target site， and know if the image is loaded or not. This is 1-bit information needed for the padding oracle attack to work: if the image is loaded， then it is valid padding， otherwise it is not.<PlainLiteral>

CAPEC-444	An adversary modifies a technology， product， or component during its development to acheive a negative impact once the system is deployed. The goal of the adversary is to modify the system in such a way that the negative impact can be leveraged when the system is later deployed. Development alteration attacks may include attacks that insert malicious logic into the system's software， modify or replace hardware components， and other attacks which negatively impact the system during development. These attacks generally require insider access to modify source code or to tamper with hardware components. The product is then delivered to the user where the negative impact can be leveraged at a later time.<PlainLiteral>

CAPEC-400	An attacker uses methods to deactivate a passive RFID tag for the purpose of rendering the tag， badge， card， or object containing the tag unresponsive. RFID tags are used primarily for access control， inventory， or anti-theft devices. The purpose of attacking the RFID chip is to disable or damage the chip without causing damage to the object housing it. When correctly performed the RFID chip can be disabled or destroyed without visible damage or marking to whatever item or device containing the chip. Attacking the chip directly allows for the security device or method to be bypassed without directly damaging the device itself， such as an alarm system or computer system Various methods exist for damaging or deactivating RFID tags. For example， most common RFID chips can be permanently destroyed by creating a small electromagnetic pulse near the chip itself. One method employed requires the modifying a disposable camera by disconnecting the flash bulb and soldering a copper coil to the capacitor. Firing the camera in this configuration near any RFID chip-based device creates an EMP pulse sufficient to destroy the chip without leaving evidence of tampering. So far this attack has been demonstrated to work against RFID chips in the 13.56 MHz range.<PlainLiteral>

CAPEC-79	This attack targets the encoding of the Slash characters. An attacker would try to exploit common filtering problems related to the use of the slashes characters to gain access to resources on the target host. Directory-driven systems， such as file systems and databases， typically use the slash character to indicate traversal between directories or other container components. For murky historical reasons， PCs (and， as a result， Microsoft OSs) choose to use a backslash， whereas the UNIX world typically makes use of the forward slash. The schizophrenic result is that many MS-based systems are required to understand both forms of the slash. This gives the attacker many opportunities to discover and abuse a number of common filtering problems. The goal of this pattern is to discover server software that only applies filters to one version， but not the other.<PlainLiteral>

CAPEC-187	An attacker exploits a weakness in a server or client's process of delivering and verifying the integrity of code supplied by an update-providing server or mechanism to cause code of the attackers' choosing to be downloaded and installed as a software update. Attacks against automated update mechanisms involve attack vectors which are specific to the type of update mechanism， but typically involve two different attack strategies: redirection or spoofing. Redirection-based attacks exploit two layers of weaknesses in server or client software to undermine the integrity of the target code-base. The first weakness involves a failure to properly authenticate a server as a source of update or patch content. This type of weakness typically results from authentication mechanisms which can be defeated， allowing a hostile server to satisfy the criteria that establish a trust relationship. The second weakness is a systemic failure to validate the identity and integrity of code downloaded from a remote location， hence the inability to distinguish malicious code from a legitimate update. One predominate type of redirection attack requires DNS spoofing or hijacking of a domain name corresponding to an update server. The target software initiates an update request and the DNS request resolves the domain name of the update server to the IP address of the attacker， at which point the software accepts updates either transmitted by or pulled from the attackers' server. Attacks against DNS mechanisms comprise an initial phase of a chain of attacks that facilitate automated update hijacking attack， and such attacks have a precedent in targeted activities that have been as complex as DNS/BIND attacks of corporate infrastructures， to untargeted attacks aimed at compromising home broadband routers， as well as attacks involving the compromise of wireless access points， as well as 'evil twin' attacks coupled with DNS redirection. Due to the plethora of options open to the attacker in forcing name resolution to arbitrary servers the Automated Update Hijacking attack strategies are the tip of the spear for many multi-stage attack chains. The second weakness that is exploited by the attacker is the lack of integrity checking by the software in validating the update. Software which relies only upon domain name resolution to establish the identity of update code is particularly vulnerable， because this signals an absence of other security countermeasures that could be applied to invalidate the attackers' payload on basis of code identity， hashing， signing， encryption， and other integrity checking mechanisms. Redirection-based attack patterns work equally well against client-side software as well as local servers or daemons that provide software update functionality. One precedent of redirection-based attacks involves the active exploitation of Firefox extensions， such as the Google Toolbar， Yahoo Toolbar， Facebook Toolbar， and others. The second strategy employed in Automated Hijacking Attacks are spoofing strategies， including content or identity spoofing， as well as protocol spoofing. Content or identity spoofing attacks can trigger updates in software by embedding scripted mechanisms within a malicious web page， which masquerades as a legitimate update source. Scripting mechanisms communicate with software components and trigger updates from locations specified by the attackers' server. Such attacks have numerous precedents， one in particular being eTrust Antivirus Webscan Automated Update Remote Code Execution vulnerability (CVE-2006-3976) and (CVE-2006-3977) whereby an ActiveX control could be remotely manipulated by an attacker controlled web page to download and execute the attackers' code without integrity checking.<PlainLiteral>

CAPEC-298	An adversary sends a UDP datagram to the remote host to determine if the host is alive. If a UDP datagram is sent to an open UDP port there is very often no response， so a typical strategy for using a UDP ping is to send the datagram to a random high port on the target. The goal is to solicit an 'ICMP port unreachable' message from the target， indicating that the host is alive. UDP pings are useful because some firewalls are not configured to block UDP datagrams sent to strange or typically unused ports， like ports in the 65K range. Additionally， while some firewalls may filter incoming ICMP， weaknesses in firewall rule-sets may allow certain types of ICMP (host unreachable， port unreachable) which are useful for UDP ping attempts.<PlainLiteral>

CAPEC-131	An adversary utilizes a resource leak on the target to deplete the quantity of the resource available to service legitimate requests. Resource leaks most often come in the form of memory leaks where memory is allocated but never released after it has served its purpose， however， theoretically， any other resource that can be reserved can be targeted if the target fails to release the reservation when the reserved resource block is no longer needed. In this attack， the adversary determines what activity results in leaked resources and then triggers that activity on the target. Since some leaks may be small， this may require a large number of requests by the adversary. However， this attack differs from a flooding attack in that the rate of requests is generally not significant. This is because the lost resources due to the leak accumulate until the target is reset， usually by restarting it. Thus， a resource-poor adversary who would be unable to flood the target can still utilize this attack. Resource depletion through leak differs from resource depletion through allocation in that， in the former， the adversary may not be able to control the size of each leaked allocation， but instead allows the leak to accumulate until it is large enough to affect the target's performance. When depleting resources through allocation， the allocated resource may eventually be released by the target so the attack relies on making sure that the allocation size itself is prohibitive of normal operations by the target.<PlainLiteral>

CAPEC-425	An adversary uses framing techniques to contextualize a conversation so that the target is more likely to be influenced by the adversary's point of view. Framing is information and experiences in life that alter the way we react to decisions we must make. This type of persuasive technique exploits the way people are conditioned to perceive data and its significance， while avoiding negative or avoidance responses from the target. Rather than a specific technique framing is a methodology of conversation that slowly encourages the target to adopt to the adversary's perspective. One technique of framing is to avoid the use of the word 'No' and to contextualize responses in a manner that is positive. When performed skillfully the target is much more likely to volunteer information or perform actions favorable to the adversary.<PlainLiteral>

CWE-837	The software requires that an actor should only be able to perform an action once， or to have only one unique action， but the software does not enforce or improperly enforces this restriction. In various applications， a user is only expected to perform a certain action once， such as voting， requesting a refund， or making a purchase. When this restriction is not enforced， sometimes this can have security implications. For example， in a voting application， an attacker could attempt to 'stuff the ballot box' by voting multiple times. If these votes are counted separately， then the attacker could directly affect who wins the vote. This could have significant business impact depending on the purpose of the software.<PlainLiteral>

CAPEC-99	Applications often need to transform data in and out of the XML format by using an XML parser. It may be possible for an attacker to inject data that may have an adverse effect on the XML parser when it is being processed. These adverse effects may include the parser crashing， consuming too much of a resource， executing too slowly， executing code supplied by an attacker， allowing usage of unintended system functionality， etc. An attacker's goal is to leverage parser failure to his or her advantage. In some cases it may be possible to jump from the data plane to the control plane via bad data being passed to an XML parser. [R.99.1]<PlainLiteral>
CAPEC-490	An adversary may execute an amplification where the size of a response is far greater than that of the request that generates it. The goal of this attack is to use a relatively few resources to create a large amount of traffic against a target server.

The larger response that is generated by the 3rd party service is then sent to the target server. By sending a large number of initial requests， the adversary can generate a tremendous amount of traffic directed at the target. The greater the discrepancy in size between the initial request and the final payload delivered to the target increased the effectiveness of this attack.<PlainLiteral>

CAPEC-240	An adversary exploits weaknesses in input validation by manipulating resource identifiers enabling the unintended modification or specification of a resource.<PlainLiteral>
CAPEC-153	An attacker exploits a weakness in input validation by controlling the format， structure， and composition of data to an input-processing interface. By supplying input of a non-standard or unexpected form an attacker can adversely impact the security of the target. For example， using a different character encoding might cause dangerous text to be treated as safe text. Alternatively， the attacker may use certain flags， such as file extensions， to make a target application believe that provided data should be handled using a certain interpreter when the data is not actually of the appropriate type. This can lead to bypassing protection mechanisms， forcing the target to use specific components for input processing， or otherwise causing the user's data to be handled differently than might otherwise be expected. This attack differs from Variable Manipulation in that Variable Manipulation attempts to subvert the target's processing through the value of the input while Input Data Manipulation seeks to control how the input is processed.<PlainLiteral>

These scripts can be immediately executed because of root code execution, not as a web server user, allowing an authenticated attacker to gain full system access.
CWE-190	The software performs a calculation that can produce an integer overflow or wraparound， when the logic assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than the original value. This can introduce other weaknesses when the calculation is used for resource management or execution control. An integer overflow or wraparound occurs when an integer value is incremented to a value that is too large to store in the associated representation. When this occurs， the value may wrap to become a very small or negative number. While this may be intended behavior in circumstances that rely on wrapping， it can have security consequences if the wrap is unexpected. This is especially the case if the integer overflow can be triggered using user-supplied inputs. This becomes security-critical when the result is used to control looping， make a security decision， or determine the offset or size in behaviors such as memory allocation， copying， concatenation， etc.<PlainLiteral>

Reference counts can be used when tracking how many objects contain a reference to a particular resource， such as in memory management or garbage collection. When the reference count reaches zero， the resource can be de-allocated or reused because there are no more objects that use it. If the reference count accidentally reaches zero， then the resource might be released too soon， even though it is still in use. If all objects no longer use the resource， but the reference count is not zero， then the resource might not ever be released.<PlainLiteral>

Certificates are commonly used for establishing secure TLS/SSL communications within a web browser.

CAPEC-398	An attacker analyzes the data on two or more magnetic strip cards and is able to generate new cards containing valid sequences that allow unauthorized access and/or impersonation of individuals. Often， magnetic strip encoding methods follow a common format for a given system laid out in up to three tracks. A single card may allow access to a corporate office complex shared by multiple companies. By analyzing how the data is stored on a card， it is also possible to create valid cards via brute-force attacks. For example， a single card can grant access to a building， a floor， and a suite number. Reading and analyzing data on multiple cards， then performing a difference analysis between data encoded on three different cards， can reveal clues as to how to generate valid cards that grant access to restricted areas of a building or suites/rooms within that building. Data stored on magstripe cards is often unencrypted， therefore comparing which data changes when two or more cards are analyzed can yield results that aid in determining the structure of the card data. A trivial example would be a common system data format on a data track which binary encodes the suite number of a building that a card will open. By creating multiple cards with differing binary encoded segments it becomes possible to enter unauthorized areas or pass through checkpoints giving the electronic ID of other persons.<PlainLiteral>

CVE-2007-2511	Buffer overflow in the user_filter_factory_create function in PHP before 5.2.2 has unknown impact and local attack vectors.
CAPEC-115	An attacker gains access to application， service， or device with the privileges of an authorized or privileged user by evading or circumventing an authentication mechanism. The attacker is therefore able to access protected data without authentication ever having taken place. This refers to an attacker gaining access equivalent to an authenticated user without ever going through an authentication procedure. This is usually the result of the attacker using an unexpected access procedure that does not go through the proper checkpoints where authentication should occur. For example， a web site might assume that all users will click through a given link in order to get to secure material and simply authenticate everyone that clicks the link. However， an attacker might be able to reach secured web content by explicitly entering the path to the content rather than clicking through the authentication link， thereby avoiding the check entirely. This attack pattern differs from other authentication attacks in that attacks of this pattern avoid authentication entirely， rather than faking authentication by exploiting flaws or by stealing credentials from legitimate users.<PlainLiteral>

CWE-680	The product performs a calculation to determine how much memory to allocate， but an integer overflow can occur that causes less memory to be allocated than expected， leading to a buffer overflow.<PlainLiteral>
CAPEC-24	In this attack， the idea is to cause an active filter to fail by causing an oversized transaction. An attacker may try to feed overly long input strings to the program in an attempt to overwhelm the filter (by causing a buffer overflow) and hoping that the filter does not fail securely (i.e. the user input is let into the system unfiltered).<PlainLiteral>
CAPEC-186	An attacker uses deceptive methods to cause a user or an automated process to download and install dangerous code believed to be a valid update that originates from an attacker controlled source. Although there are several variations to this strategy of attack， the attack methods are united in that all rely on the ability of an attacker to position and disguise malicious content such that it masquerades as a legitimate software update which is then processed by a program， undermining application integrity. As such the attack employs 'spoofing' techniques augmented by psychological or technological mechanisms to disguise the update and/or its source. Virtually all software requires frequent updates or patches， giving the attacker immense latitude when structuring the attack， as well as many targets of opportunity. Attacks involving malicious software updates can be targeted or untargeted in reference to a population of users， and can also involve manual and automatic means of payload installation. Untargeted attacks rely upon a mass delivery system such as spamming， phishing， or trojans/botnets to distribute emails or other messages to vast populations of users. Targeted attacks aim at a particular demographic or user population. Corporate Facebook or Myspace pages make it easy to target users of a specific company or affiliation without relying on email address harvesting or spamming. One phishing-assisted variation on this attack involves hosting what appears to be a software update， then harvesting actual email addresses for an organization， or generating commonly used email addresses， and then sending spam， phishing， or spear-phishing emails to the organization's users requesting that they manually download and install the malicious software update. This type of attack has also been conducted using an Instant Messaging virus payload， which harvests the names from a user's contact list and sends instant messages to those users to download and apply the update. While both methods involve a high degree of automated mechanisms to support the attack， the primary vector for achieving the installation of the update remains a manual user-directed process， although clicking a link within an IM client or web application may initiate the update. Other class of attacks focus on firmware， where malicious updates are made to the core system firmware or BIOS. Since this occurs outside the controls of the operating system， the OS detection and prevention mechanisms do not aid， thus allowing an adversary to evade defenses as well as gain persistence on the target's system.

CAPEC-80	This attack is a specific variation on leveraging alternate encodings to bypass validation logic. This attack leverages the possibility to encode potentially harmful input in UTF-8 and submit it to applications not expecting or effective at validating this encoding standard making input filtering difficult. UTF-8 (8-bit UCS/Unicode Transformation Format) is a variable-length character encoding for Unicode. Legal UTF-8 characters are one to four bytes long. However， early version of the UTF-8 specification got some entries wrong (in some cases it permitted overlong characters). UTF-8 encoders are supposed to use the 'shortest possible' encoding， but naive decoders may accept encodings that are longer than necessary. According to the RFC 3629， a particularly subtle form of this attack can be carried out against a parser which performs security-critical validity checks against the UTF-8 encoded form of its input， but interprets certain illegal octet sequences as characters.<PlainLiteral>

An adversary can use this to read or write to memory locations or files， or simply to manipulate the value of the resulting text in unexpected ways. Reading or writing memory may result in program crashes and writing memory could result in the execution of arbitrary code if the adversary can write to the program stack.<PlainLiteral>

CAPEC-458	An attacker inserts malicious logic into a product or technology via flashing the on-board memory with a code-base that contains malicious logic. Various attacks exist against the integrity of flash memory， the most direct being rootkits coded into the BIOS or chipset of a device. Such attacks are very difficult to detect because the malicious code resides outside the filesystem or RAM， and in the underlying byte-code that drives the processor. Many devices， such as the recent attacks against digital picture frames， contain only a microprocessor and a small amount of solid-state memory， rendering these devices ideal for 'flash' based malware or malicious logic. One of the pernicious characteristics of flash memory based attacks is that the malicious code can survive even a total format of the hard-drive and reinstallation of the host operating system. Virtually any device which can be integrated into a computer system is susceptible to these attacks. Additionally， any peripheral device which interfaces with the computer bus could extract or sniff confidential data， even on systems employing full-disk encryption. Trojan code placed into a video card's chipset would continue to perform its function irrespective of the host operating system， and would be invisible to all known antivirus. The threats extend to consumer products such as camcorders， digital cameras， or any consumer electronic device with an embedded microcontroller.<PlainLiteral>

CAPEC-651	An adversary intercepts a form of communication (e.g. text， audio， video) by way of software (e.g.， microphone and audio recording application)， hardware (e.g.， recording equipment)， or physical means (e.g.， physical proximity). The goal of eavesdropping is typically to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information about the target for financial， personal， political， or other gains. Eavesdropping is different from a sniffing attack as it does not take place on a network-based communication channel (e.g.， IP traffic). Instead， it entails listening in on the raw audio source of a conversation between two or more parties.<PlainLiteral>
CVE-2017-9389	An issue was discovered on Vera VeraEdge 1.7.19 and Veralite 1.7.481 devices. The device provides a web user interface that allows a user to manage the device. As a part of the functionality the device allows a user to install applications written in the Lua programming language. Also the interface allows any user to write his/her application in the Lua language. However, this functionality is not protected by authentication and this allows an attacker to run arbitrary Lua code on the device. The POST request is forwarded to LuaUPNP daemon on the device. This binary handles the received Lua code in the function "LU::JobHandler_LuaUPnP::RunLua(LU::JobHandler_LuaUPnP *__hidden this, LU::UPnPActionWrapper *)". The value in the "code" parameter is then passed to the function "LU::LuaInterface::RunCode(char const*)" which actually loads the Lua engine and runs the code.

CAPEC-469	An attacker performs flooding at the HTTP level to bring down only a particular web application rather than anything listening on a TCP/IP connection. This denial of service attack requires substantially fewer packets to be sent which makes DoS harder to detect. This is an equivalent of SYN flood in HTTP. The idea is to keep the HTTP session alive indefinitely and then repeat that hundreds of times. This attack targets resource depletion weaknesses in web server software. The web server will wait to attacker's responses on the initiated HTTP sessions while the connection threads are being exhausted.<PlainLiteral>
CWE-556	Configuring an ASP.NET application to run with impersonated credentials may give the application unnecessary privileges. The use of impersonated credentials allows an ASP.NET application to run with either the privileges of the client on whose behalf it is executing or with arbitrary privileges granted in its configuration.<PlainLiteral>
CVE-2009-0802	Qbik WinGate, when transparent interception mode is enabled, uses the HTTP Host header to determine the remote endpoint, which allows remote attackers to bypass access controls for Flash, Java, Silverlight, and probably other technologies, and possibly communicate with restricted intranet sites, via a crafted web page that causes a client to send HTTP requests with a modified Host header.
CAPEC-287	An adversary uses a SYN scan to determine the status of ports on the remote target. SYN scanning is the most common type of port scanning that is used because of its enormous advantages and few drawbacks. As a result， novice attackers tend to overly rely on the SYN scan while performing system reconnaissance. As a scanning method， the primary advantages of SYN scanning are its universality and speed. RFC 793 defines the required behavior of any TCP/IP device in that an incoming connection request begins with a SYN packet， which in turn must be followed by a SYN/ACK packet from the receiving service. For this reason， like TCP Connect scanning， SYN scanning works against any TCP stack. Unlike TCP Connect scanning， it is possible to scan thousands of ports per second using this method. This type of scanning is usually referred to as 'half-open' scanning because it does not complete the three-way handshake. The scanning rate is extremely fast because no time is wasted completing the handshake or tearing down the connection. TCP SYN scanning can also immediately detect 3 of the 4 important types of port status: open， closed， and filtered. When a SYN is sent to an open port and unfiltered port， a SYN/ACK will be generated. This technique allows an attacker to scan through stateful firewalls due to the common configuration that TCP SYN segments for a new connection will be allowed for almost any port. When a SYN packet is sent to a closed port a RST is generated， indicating the port is closed. When SYN scanning to a particular port generates no response， or when the request triggers ICMP Type 3 unreachable errors， the port is filtered.<PlainLiteral>

CVE-2017-10724	Recently it was discovered as a part of the research on IoT devices in the most recent firmware for Shekar Endoscope that an attacker connected to the device Wi-Fi SSID can exploit a memory corruption issue and execute remote code on the device. This device acts as an Endoscope camera that allows its users to use it in various industrial systems and settings, car garages, and also in some cases in the medical clinics to get access to areas that are difficult for a human being to reach. Any breach of this system can allow an attacker to get access to video feed and pictures viewed by that user and might allow them to get a foot hold in air gapped networks especially in case of nation critical infrastructure/industries. The firmware contains binary uvc_stream that is the UDP daemon which is responsible for handling all the UDP requests that the device receives. The client application sends a UDP request to change the Wi-Fi name which contains the following format: "SETCMD0001+0002+[2 byte length of wifipassword]+[Wifipassword]. This request is handled by "control_Dev_thread" function which at address "0x00409AE4" compares the incoming request and determines if the 10th byte is 02 and if it is then it redirects to 0x0040A7D8, which calls the function "setwifipassword". The function "setwifipassword" uses a memcpy function but uses the length of the payload obtained by using strlen function as the third parameter which is the number of bytes to copy and this allows an attacker to overflow the function and control the $PC value.
CAPEC-60	This attack targets the reuse of valid session ID to spoof the target system in order to gain privileges.

CAPEC-147	An attacker initiates a resource depletion attack where a large number of small XML messages are delivered at a sufficiently rapid rate to cause a denial of service or crash of the target. Transactions such as repetitive SOAP transactions can deplete resources faster than a simple flooding attack because of the additional resources used by the SOAP protocol and the resources necessary to process SOAP messages. The transactions used are immaterial as long as they cause resource utilization on the target. In other words， this is a normal flooding attack augmented by using messages that will require extra processing on the target.<PlainLiteral>

CWE-539	Persistent cookies are cookies that are stored on the browser's hard drive. This can cause security and privacy issues depending on the information stored in the cookie and how it is accessed. Cookies are small bits of data that are sent by the web application but stored locally in the browser. This lets the application use the cookie to pass information between pages and store variable information. The web application controls what information is stored in a cookie and how it is used. Typical types of information stored in cookies are session Identifiers， personalization and customization information， and in rare cases even usernames to enable automated logins. There are two different types of cookies: session cookies and persistent cookies. Session cookies just live in the browser's memory， and are not stored anywhere， but persistent cookies are stored on the browser's hard drive.<PlainLiteral>

The macOS binary openvpn_launcher.64 is setuid root. This binary creates /tmp/pia_upscript.sh when executed. Because the file creation mask (umask) is not reset, the umask value is inherited from the calling process. This value can be manipulated to cause the privileged binary to create files with world writable permissions. A local unprivileged user can modify /tmp/pia_upscript.sh during the connect process to execute arbitrary code as the root user.
CWE-98	The PHP application receives input from an upstream component， but it does not restrict or incorrectly restricts the input before its usage in 'require，' 'include，' or similar functions.

CAPEC-122	An adversary is able to exploit features of the target that should be reserved for privileged users or administrators but are exposed to use by lower or non-privileged accounts. Access to sensitive information and functionality must be controlled to ensure that only authorized users are able to access these resources. If access control mechanisms are absent or misconfigured， a user may be able to access resources that are intended only for higher level users. An adversary may be able to exploit this to utilize a less trusted account to gain information and perform activities reserved for more trusted accounts. This attack differs from privilege escalation and other privilege stealing attacks in that the adversary never actually escalates their privileges but instead is able to use a lesser degree of privilege to access resources that should be (but are not) reserved for higher privilege accounts. Likewise， the adversary does not exploit trust or subvert systems - all control functionality is working as configured but the configuration does not adequately protect sensitive resources at an appropriate level.<PlainLiteral>

One of the simplest forms of this attack would be the creation of an email message with a modified 'From' field in order to appear that the message was sent from someone other than the actual sender. The root of the attack (in this case the email system) fails to properly authenticate the source and this results in the reader incorrectly performing the instructed action. Results of the attack vary depending on the details of the attack， but common results include privilege escalation， obfuscation of other attacks， and data corruption/manipulation.<PlainLiteral>

CAPEC-226	An attacker manipulates an existing credential in order to gain access to a target application. Session credentials allow users to identify themselves to a service after an initial authentication without needing to resend the authentication information (usually a username and password) with every message. An attacker may be able to manipulate a credential sniffed from an existing connection in order to gain access to a target server. For example， a credential in the form of a web cookie might have a field that indicates the access rights of a user. By manually tweaking this cookie， a user might be able to increase their access rights to the server. Alternately an attacker may be able to manipulate an existing credential to appear as a different user. This attack differs from falsification through prediction in that the user bases their modified credentials off existing credentials instead of using patterns detected in prior credentials to create a new credential that is accepted because it fits the pattern. As a result， an attacker may be able to impersonate other users or elevate their permissions to a targeted service.<PlainLiteral>

CAPEC-199	An adversary uses alternate forms of keywords or commands that result in the same action as the primary form but which may not be caught by filters. For example， many keywords are processed in a case insensitive manner. If the site's web filtering algorithm does not convert all tags into a consistent case before the comparison with forbidden keywords it is possible to bypass filters (e.g.， incomplete black lists) by using an alternate case structure. For example， the 'script' tag using the alternate forms of 'Script' or 'ScRiPt' may bypass filters where 'script' is the only form tested. Other variants using different syntax representations are also possible as well as using pollution meta-characters or entities that are eventually ignored by the rendering engine.

#1184:26	j)如何评价结果。
CAPEC-74	The adversary modifies state information maintained by the target software in user-accessible locations. If successful， the target software will use this tainted state information and execute in an unintended manner. State management is an important function within an application. User state maintained by the application can include usernames， payment information， browsing history as well as application-specific contents such as items in a shopping cart. Manipulating user state can be employed by an adversary to elevate privilege， conduct fraudulent transactions or otherwise modify the flow of the application to derive certain benefits.<PlainLiteral>
CWE-353	The software uses a transmission protocol that does not include a mechanism for verifying the integrity of the data during transmission， such as a checksum. If integrity check values or 'checksums' are omitted from a protocol， there is no way of determining if data has been corrupted in transmission. The lack of checksum functionality in a protocol removes the first application-level check of data that can be used. The end-to-end philosophy of checks states that integrity checks should be performed at the lowest level that they can be completely implemented. Excluding further sanity checks and input validation performed by applications， the protocol's checksum is the most important level of checksum， since it can be performed more completely than at any previous level and takes into account entire messages， as opposed to single packets.<PlainLiteral>

title_1947	"各组织应自行解决。"""
CAPEC-588	This type of attack is a form of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) where a malicious script is inserted into the client-side HTML being parsed by a web browser. Content served by a vulnerable web application includes script code used to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM). This script code either does not properly validate input， or does not perform proper output encoding， thus creating an opportunity for an adversary to inject a malicious script launch a XSS attack. A key distinction between other XSS attacks and DOM-based attacks is that in other XSS attacks， the malicious script runs when the vulnerable web page is initially loaded， while a DOM-based attack executes sometime after the page loads. Another distinction of DOM-based attacks is that in some cases， the malicious script is never sent to the vulnerable web server at all. An attack like this is guaranteed to bypass any server-side filtering attempts to protect users.<PlainLiteral>

CAPEC-494	An attacker may execute a TCP Fragmentation attack against a target with the intention of avoiding filtering rules. IP fragmentation occurs when an IP datagram is larger than the MTU of the route the datagram has to traverse. The attacker attempts to fragment the TCP packet such that the headers flag field is pushed into the second fragment which typically is not filtered. This behavior defeats some IPS and firewall filters who typically check the FLAGS in the header of the first packet since dropping this packet prevents the following fragments from being processed and assembled. Another variation is overlapping fragments thus that an innocuous first segment passes the filter and the second segment overwrites the TCP header data with the true payload which is malicious in nature. The malicious payload manipulated properly may lead to a DoS due to resource consumption or kernel crash. Additionally the fragmentation could be used in conjunction with sending fragments at a rate slightly slower than the timeout to cause a DoS condition by forcing resources that assemble the packet to wait an inordinate amount of time to complete the task. The fragmentation identification numbers could also be duplicated very easily as there are only 16 bits in IPv4 so only 65536 packets are needed.<PlainLiteral>

CAPEC-49	In this attack， the adversary tries every possible value for a password until they succeed. A brute force attack， if feasible computationally， will always be successful because it will essentially go through all possible passwords given the alphabet used (lower case letters， upper case letters， numbers， symbols， etc.) and the maximum length of the password. A system will be particularly vulnerable to this type of an attack if it does not have a proper enforcement mechanism in place to ensure that passwords selected by users are strong passwords that comply with an adequate password policy. In practice a pure brute force attack on passwords is rarely used， unless the password is suspected to be weak. Other password cracking methods exist that are far more effective (e.g. dictionary attacks， rainbow tables， etc.). Knowing the password policy on the system can make a brute force attack more efficient. For instance， if the policy states that all passwords must be of a certain level， there is no need to check smaller candidates.<PlainLiteral>

Depending on what that action control is， the attacker may have just tricked the victim into executing some potentially privileged (and most undesired) functionality in the target system to which the victim is authenticated.

CAPEC-195	A Principal Spoof is a form of Identity Spoofing where an adversary pretends to be some other person in an interaction. This is often accomplished by crafting a message (either written， verbal， or visual) that appears to come from a person other than the adversary. Phishing and Pharming attacks often attempt to do this so that their attempts to gather sensitive information appear to come from a legitimate source. A Principal Spoof does not use stolen or spoofed authentication credentials， instead relying on the appearance and content of the message to reflect identity. The possible outcomes of a Principal Spoof mirror those of Identity Spoofing. (e.g.， escalation of privilege and false attribution of data or activities) Likewise， most techniques for Identity Spoofing (crafting messages or intercepting and replaying or modifying messages) can be used for a Principal Spoof attack. However， because a Principal Spoof is used to impersonate a person， social engineering can be both an attack technique (using social techniques to generate evidence in support of a false identity) as well as a possible outcome (manipulating people's perceptions by making statements or performing actions under a target's name).<PlainLiteral>

CAPEC-320	This OS fingerprinting probe examines the remote server's implementation of TCP timestamps. Not all operating systems implement timestamps within the TCP header， but when timestamps are used then this provides the attacker with a means to guess the operating system of the target. The attacker begins by probing any active TCP service in order to get response which contains a TCP timestamp. Different Operating systems update the timestamp value using different intervals. This type of analysis is most accurate when multiple timestamp responses are received and then analyzed. TCP timestamps can be found in the TCP Options field of the TCP header.<PlainLiteral>
CAPEC-447	An adversary modifies the design of a technology， product， or component to acheive a negative impact once the system is deployed. In this type of attack， the goal of the adversary is to modify the design of the system， prior to development starting， in such a way that the negative impact can be leveraged when the system is later deployed. Design alteration attacks differ from development alteration attacks in that design alteration attacks take place prior to development and which then may or may not be developed by the adverary. Design alteration attacks include modifying system designs to degrade system performance， cause unexpected states or errors， and general design changes that may lead to additional vulnerabilities. These attacks generally require insider access to modify design documents， but they may also be spoofed via web communications. The product is then developed and delivered to the user where the negative impact can be leveraged at a later time.<PlainLiteral>

CAPEC-148	An adversary modifies content to make it contain something other than what the original content producer intended while keeping the apparent source of the content unchanged. The term content spoofing is most often used to describe modification of web pages hosted by a target to display the adversary's content instead of the owner's content. However， any content can be spoofed， including the content of email messages， file transfers， or the content of other network communication protocols. Content can be modified at the source (e.g. modifying the source file for a web page) or in transit (e.g. intercepting and modifying a message between the sender and recipient). Usually， the adversary will attempt to hide the fact that the content has been modified， but in some cases， such as with web site defacement， this is not necessary. Content Spoofing can lead to malware exposure， financial fraud (if the content governs financial transactions)， privacy violations， and other unwanted outcomes.<PlainLiteral>

CVE-2005-0408	CitrusDB 0.3.6 and earlier generates easily predictable MD5 hashes of the user name for the id_hash cookie, which allows remote attackers to bypass authentication and gain privileges by calculating the MD5 checksum of the user name combined with the "boogaadeeboo" string, which is hard-coded in the $hidden_hash variable.
CAPEC-172	An attacker exploits weaknesses in timing or state maintaining functions to perform actions that would otherwise be prevented by the execution flow of the target code and processes. An example of a state attack might include manipulation of an application's information to change the apparent credentials or similar information， possibly allowing the application to access material it would not normally be allowed to access. A common example of a timing attack is a test-action race condition where some state information is tested and， if it passes， an action is performed. If the attacker can change the state between the time that the application performs the test and the time the action is performed， then they might be able to manipulate the outcome of the action to malicious ends.<PlainLiteral>
#1176:53	a)应执行安全保护措施，以防代码在内存中进行未授权的执行。
CAPEC-166	An attacker forces the target into a previous state in order to leverage potential weaknesses in the target dependent upon a prior configuration or state-dependent factors. Even in cases where an attacker may not be able to directly control the configuration of the targeted application， they may be able to reset the configuration to a prior state since many applications implement reset functions. Since these functions are usually intended as emergency features to return an application to a stable configuration if the current configuration degrades functionality， they may not be as strongly secured as other configuration options. The resetting of values is dangerous as it may enable undesired functionality， disable services， or modify access controls. At the very least this is a nuisance attack since the administrator will need to re-apply their configuration. At worst， this attack can open avenues for powerful attacks against the application， and， if it isn't obvious that the configuration has been reset， these vulnerabilities may be present a long time before they are notices.<PlainLiteral>
CAPEC-4	This attack relies on the attacker using unexpected formats for representing IP addresses. Networked applications may expect network location information in a specific format， such as fully qualified domains names (FQDNs)， URL， IP address， or IP Address ranges. If the location information is not validated against a variety of different possible encodings and formats， the adversary can use an alternate format to bypass application access control.<PlainLiteral>

CAPEC-540	An adversary attacks a target by providing input that causes an application to read beyond the boundary of a defined buffer.

This type of attack may result in exposure of sensitive information， a system crash， or arbitrary code execution.<PlainLiteral>

CAPEC-146	An adversary corrupts or modifies the content of XML schema information passed between a client and server for the purpose of undermining the security of the target. XML Schemas provide the structure and content definitions for XML documents. Schema poisoning is the ability to manipulate a schema either by replacing or modifying it to compromise the programs that process documents that use this schema. Possible attacks are denial of service attacks by modifying the schema so that it does not contain required information for subsequent processing. For example， the unaltered schema may require a @name attribute in all submitted documents. If the adversary removes this attribute from the schema then documents created using the new grammar may lack this field， which may cause the processing application to enter an unexpected state or record incomplete data. In addition， manipulation of the data types described in the schema may affect the results of calculations taken by the document reader. For example， a float field could be changed to an int field. Finally， the adversary may change the encoding defined in the schema for certain fields allowing the contents to bypass filters that scan for dangerous strings. For example， the modified schema might us a URL encoding instead of ASCII， and a filter that catches a semicolon (;) might fail to detect its URL encoding (%3B).<PlainLiteral>

CAPEC-459	An adversary exploits a weakness in the MD5 hash algorithm (weak collision resistance) to generate a certificate signing request (CSR) that contains collision blocks in the 'to be signed' part. The adversary specially crafts two different， but valid X.509 certificates that when hashed with the MD5 algorithm would yield the same value. The adversary then sends the CSR for one of the certificates to the Certification Authority which uses the MD5 hashing algorithm. That request is completely valid and the Certificate Authority issues an X.509 certificate to the adversary which is signed with its private key. An adversary then takes that signed blob and inserts it into another X.509 certificate that the attacker generated. Due to the MD5 collision， both certificates， though different， hash to the same value and so the signed blob works just as well in the second certificate. The net effect is that the adversary's second X.509 certificate， which the Certification Authority has never seen， is now signed and validated by that Certification Authority. To make the attack more interesting， the second certificate could be not just a regular certificate， but rather itself a signing certificate. Thus the adversary is able to start their own Certification Authority that is anchored in its root of trust in the legitimate Certification Authority that has signed the attackers' first X.509 certificate. If the original Certificate Authority was accepted by default by browsers， so will now the Certificate Authority set up by the adversary and of course any certificates that it signs. So the adversary is now able to generate any SSL certificates to impersonate any web server， and the user's browser will not issue any warning to the victim. This can be used to compromise HTTPS communications and other types of systems where PKI and X.509 certificates may be used (e.g.， VPN， IPSec).<PlainLiteral>

CAPEC-162	An adversary exploits a weakness in the server's trust of client-side processing by modifying data on the client-side， such as price information， and then submitting this data to the server， which processes the modified data. For example， eShoplifting is a data manipulation attack against an on-line merchant during a purchasing transaction. The manipulation of price， discount or quantity fields in the transaction message allows the adversary to acquire items at a lower cost than the merchant intended. The adversary performs a normal purchasing transaction but edits hidden fields within the HTML form response that store price or other information to give themselves a better deal. The merchant then uses the modified pricing information in calculating the cost of the selected items.<PlainLiteral>

CAPEC-330	An adversary uses a technique to generate an ICMP Error message (Port Unreachable， Destination Unreachable， Redirect， Source Quench， Time Exceeded， Parameter Problem) from a target and then analyze the integrity of data returned or 'Quoted' from the originating request that generated the error message. For this purpose 'Port Unreachable' error messages are often used， as generating them requires the attacker to send a UDP datagram to a closed port on the target. When replying with an ICMP error message some IP/ICMP stack implementations change aspects of the IP header， change or reverse certain byte orders， reset certain field values to default values which differ between operating system and firmware implementations， and make other changes. Some IP/ICMP stacks are decidedly broken， indicating an idiosyncratic behavior that differs from the RFC specifications， such as the case when miscalculations affect a field value. A tremendous amount of information about the host operating system can be deduced from its 'echoing' characteristics. Notably， inspection of key protocol header fields， including the echoed header fields of the encapsulating protocol can yield a wealth of data about the host operating system or firmware version.<PlainLiteral>

CAPEC-519	An attacker with access to a manufacturer's documentation containing requirements allocation and software design processes maliciously alters the documentation in order to cause errors in system design. This allows the attacker to take advantage of a weakness in a deployed system of the manufacturer for malicious purposes.<PlainLiteral>
CAPEC-8	This attack targets libraries or shared code modules which are vulnerable to buffer overflow attacks. An attacker who has access to an API may try to embed malicious code in the API function call and exploit a buffer overflow vulnerability in the function's implementation. All clients that make use of the code library thus become vulnerable by association. This has a very broad effect on security across a system， usually affecting more than one software process.<PlainLiteral>

CWE-138	The software receives input from an upstream component， but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component. Most languages and protocols have their own special elements such as characters and reserved words. These special elements can carry control implications. If software does not prevent external control or influence over the inclusion of such special elements， the control flow of the program may be altered from what was intended. For example， both Unix and Windows interpret the symbol < ('less than') as meaning 'read input from a file'.<PlainLiteral>

CAPEC-504	An adversary， through a previously installed malicious application， monitors the task list maintained by the operating system and waits for a specific legitimate task to become active. Once the task is detected， the malicious application launches a new task in the foreground that mimics the user interface of the legitimate task. At this point， the user thinks that they are interacting with the legitimate task that they started， but instead they are interacting with the malicious application. This type of attack is most often used to obtain sensitive information (e.g.， credentials) from the user.

CVE-2019-1010250	The Linux Foundation ONOS 2.0.0 and earlier is affected by: Poor Input-validation. The impact is: A network administrator (or attacker) can install unintended flow rules in the switch by mistake. The component is: createFlow() and createFlows() functions in FlowWebResource.java (RESTful service). The attack vector is: network management and connectivity.
CAPEC-402	An attacker exploits a weakness in ATA security on a drive to gain access to the information the drive contains without supplying the proper credentials. ATA Security is often employed to protect hard disk information from unauthorized access. The mechanism requires the user to type in a password before the BIOS is allowed access to drive contents. Some implementations of ATA security will accept the ATA command to update the password without the user having authenticated with the BIOS. This occurs because the security mechanism assumes the user has first authenticated via the BIOS prior to sending commands to the drive. Various methods exist for exploiting this flaw， the most common being installing the ATA protected drive into a system lacking ATA security features (a.k.a. hot swapping). Once the drive is installed into the new system the BIOS can be used to reset the drive password.<PlainLiteral>
CWE-627	In a language where the user can influence the name of a variable at runtime， if the variable names are not controlled， an attacker can read or write to arbitrary variables， or access arbitrary functions.

CVE-2009-3759	Multiple cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities in sample code in the XenServer Resource Kit in Citrix XenCenterWeb allow remote attackers to hijack the authentication of administrators for (1) requests that change the password via the username parameter to config/changepw.php or (2) stop a virtual machine via the stop_vmname parameter to hardstopvm.php.  NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third party information.
CAPEC-38	This pattern of attack sees an adversary load a malicious resource into a program's standard path so that when a known command is executed then the system instead executes the malicious component. The adversary can either modify the search path a program uses， like a PATH variable or classpath， or they can manipulate resources on the path to point to their malicious components. J2EE applications and other component based applications that are built from multiple binaries can have very long list of dependencies to execute.

Supported versions that are affected are Java SE: 7u221, 8u212, 11.0.3 and 12.0.1; Java SE Embedded: 8u211. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise Java SE, Java SE Embedded. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized ability to cause a partial denial of service (partial DOS) of Java SE, Java SE Embedded. Note: This vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets (in Java SE 8), that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability can also be exploited by using APIs in the specified Component, e.g., through a web service which supplies data to the APIs. CVSS 3.0 Base Score 5.3 (Availability impacts).

CAPEC-181	An attacker creates a transparent overlay using flash in order to intercept user actions for the purpose of performing a clickjacking attack. In this technique， the Flash file provides a transparent overlay over HTML content. Because the Flash application is on top of the content， user actions， such as clicks， are caught by the Flash application rather than the underlying HTML. The action is then interpreted by the overlay to perform the actions the attacker wishes.<PlainLiteral>

CAPEC-396	An attacker bypasses the security of a card-based system by using techniques such as cloning access cards or using brute-force techniques. Card-based systems are widespread throughout business， government， and supply-chain management. Attacks against card-based systems vary widely based on the attackers' goals， but commonly include unauthorized reproduction of cards， brute-force creation of valid card-values， and attacks against systems which read or process card data. Due to the inherent weaknesses of card and badge security， high security environments will rarely rely upon the card or badge alone as a security mechanism. Common card based systems are used for financial transactions， user identification， and access control. Cloning attacks involve making an unauthorized copy of a user's card while brute-force attacks involve creating new cards with valid values. Denial of service attacks against card-based systems involve rendering the reader， or the card itself， to become disabled. Such attacks may be useful in a fail-closed system for keeping authorized users out of a location while a crime is in progress， whereas fail-open systems may grant access， or an alarm my fail to trigger， if an attacker disables or damages the card authentication device.<PlainLiteral>
CAPEC-98	Phishing is a social engineering technique where an attacker masquerades as a legitimate entity with which the victim might do business in order to prompt the user to reveal some confidential information (very frequently authentication credentials) that can later be used by an attacker.

CAPEC-174	An adversary takes advantage of improper data validation to inject malicious global parameters into a Flash file embedded within an HTML document. Flash files can leverage user-submitted data to configure the Flash document and access the embedding HTML document. These 'FlashVars' are most often passed to the Flash file via URL arguments or from the Object or Embed tag within the embedding HTML document. If these FlashVars are not properly sanitized， an adversary may be able to embed malicious content (such as scripts) into the HTML document. The injected parameters can also provide the adversary control over other objects within the Flash file as well as full control over the parent document's DOM model. As such， this is a form of HTTP parameter injection， but the abilities granted to the Flash document (such as access to a page's document model， including associated cookies) make this attack more flexible. Flash Parameter Injection attacks can also preface further attacks such as various forms of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks in addition to Session Hijacking attacks.<PlainLiteral>

Data may be shared between multiple applications or between multiple threads of a single application. Data sharing is usually accomplished through mutual access to a single memory location. If an adversary can manipulate this shared data (usually by co-opting one of the applications or threads) the other applications or threads using the shared data will often continue to trust the validity of the compromised shared data and use it in their calculations. This can result in invalid trust assumptions， corruption of additional data through the normal operations of the other users of the shared data， or even cause a crash or compromise of the sharing applications.<PlainLiteral>

CAPEC-51	SOA and Web Services often use a registry to perform look up， get schema information， and metadata about services. A poisoned registry can redirect (think phishing for servers) the service requester to a malicious service provider， provide incorrect information in schema or metadata (to effect a denial of service)， and delete information about service provider interfaces. WS-Addressing is used to virtualize services， provide return addresses and other routing information， however， unless the WS-Addressing headers are protected they are vulnerable to rewriting. The attacker that can rewrite WS-addressing information gains the ability to route service requesters to any service providers， and the ability to route service provider response to any service. Content in a registry is deployed by the service provider. The registry in an SOA or Web Services system can be accessed by the service requester via UDDI or other protocol. The basic flow for the attacker consists of either altering the data at rest in the registry or uploading malicious content by spoofing a service provider. The service requester is then redirected to send its requests and/or responses to services the attacker controls.<PlainLiteral>

CAPEC-592	This type of attack is a form of Cross-site Scripting (XSS) where a malicious script is persistenly 鈥渟tored鈥?within the data storage of a vulnerable web application. Initially presented by an adversary to the vulnerable web application， the malicious script is incorrectly considered valid input and is not properly encoded by the web application. A victim is then convinced to use the web application in a way that creates a response that includes the malicious script. This response is subsequently sent to the victim and the malicious script is executed by the victim's browser. To launch a successful Stored XSS attack， an adversary looks for places where stored input data is used in the generation of a response. This often involves elements that are not expected to host scripts such as image tags (<img>)， or the addition of event attibutes such as onload and onmouseover. These elements are often not subject to the same input validation， output encoding， and other content filtering and checking routines.<PlainLiteral>

CAPEC-467	An attacker harvests identifying information about a victim via an active session that the victim's browser has with a social networking site. A victim may have the social networking site open in one tab or perhaps is simply using the 'remember me' feature to keep his or her session with the social networking site active. An attacker induces a payload to execute in the victim's browser that transparently to the victim initiates a request to the social networking site (e.g.， via available social network site APIs) to retrieve identifying information about a victim. While some of this information may be public， the attacker is able to harvest this information in context and may use it for further attacks on the user (e.g.， spear phishing). In one example of an attack， an attacker may post a malicious posting that contains an image with an embedded link. The link actually requests identifying information from the social networking site. A victim who views the malicious posting in his or her browser will have sent identifying information to the attacker， as long as the victim had an active session with the social networking site. There are many other ways in which the attacker may get the payload to execute in the victim's browser mainly by finding a way to hide it in some reputable site that the victim visits. The attacker could also send the link to the victim in an e-mail and trick the victim into clicking on the link. This attack is basically a cross site request forgery attack with two main differences. First， there is no action that is performed on behalf of the user aside from harvesting information. So standard CSRF protection may not work in this situation. Second， what is important in this attack pattern is the nature of the data being harvested， which is identifying information that can be obtained and used in context. This real time harvesting of identifying information can be used as a prelude for launching real time targeted social engineering attacks on the victim.<PlainLiteral>

CVE-2015-3905	Buffer overflow in the set_cs_start function in t1disasm.c in t1utils before 1.39 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted font file.
CAPEC-305	An adversary uses TCP ACK segments to gather information about firewall or ACL configuration. The purpose of this type of scan is to discover information about filter configurations rather than port state. This type of scanning is rarely useful alone， but when combined with SYN scanning， gives a more complete picture of the type of firewall rules that are present. When a TCP ACK segment is sent to a closed port， or sent out-of-sync to a listening port， the RFC 793 expected behavior is for the device to respond with a RST. Getting RSTs back in response to a ACK scan gives the attacker useful information that can be used to infer the type of firewall present. Stateful firewalls will discard out-of-sync ACK packets， leading to no response. When this occurs the port is marked as filtered. When RSTs are received in response， the ports are marked as unfiltered， as the ACK packets solicited the expected behavior from a port. When combined with SYN techniques an attacker can gain a more complete picture of which types of packets get through to a host and thereby map out its firewall rule-set. ACK scanning， when combined with SYN scanning， also allows the adversary to analyze whether a firewall is stateful or non-stateful. If a SYN solicits a SYN/ACK or a RST and an ACK solicits a RST， the port is unfiltered by any firewall type. If a SYN solicits a SYN/ACK， but an ACK generates no response， the port is statefully filtered. When a SYN generates neither a SYN/ACK or a RST， but an ACK generates a RST， the port is statefully filtered. When neither SYN nor ACK generates any response， the port is blocked by a specific firewall rule， which can occur via any type of firewall. TCP ACK Scans are somewhat faster and more stealthy than other types of scans but often requires rather sophisticated analysis by an experienced person. A skilled adversary may use this method to map out firewall rules， but the results of ACK scanning will be less useful to a novice.<PlainLiteral>
CWE-649	The software uses obfuscation or encryption of inputs that should not be mutable by an external actor， but the software does not use integrity checks to detect if those inputs have been modified. When an application relies on obfuscation or incorrectly applied / weak encryption to protect client-controllable tokens or parameters， that may have an effect on the user state， system state， or some decision made on the server. Without protecting the tokens/parameters for integrity， the application is vulnerable to an attack where an adversary blindly traverses the space of possible values of the said token/parameter in order to attempt to gain an advantage. The goal of the attacker is to find another admissible value that will somehow elevate their privileges in the system， disclose information or change the behavior of the system in some way beneficial to the attacker. If the application does not protect these critical tokens/parameters for integrity， it will not be able to determine that these values have been tampered with. Measures that are used to protect data for confidentiality should not be relied upon to provide the integrity service.<PlainLiteral>

CAPEC-306	An adversary engages in TCP Window scanning to analyze port status and operating system type. TCP Window scanning uses the ACK scanning method but examine the TCP Window Size field of response RST packets to make certain inferences. While TCP Window Scans are fast and relatively stealthy， they work against fewer TCP stack implementations than any other type of scan. Some operating systems return a positive TCP window size when a RST packet is sent from an open port， and a negative value when the RST originates from a closed port. TCP Window scanning is one of the most complex scan types， and its results are difficult to interpret. Window scanning alone rarely yields useful information， but when combined with other types of scanning is more useful. It is a generally more reliable means of making inference about operating system versions than port status.<PlainLiteral>

CAPEC-591	This type of attack is a form of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) where a malicious script is 鈥渞eflected鈥?off a vulnerable web application and then executed by a victim's browser. The process starts with an adversary delivering a malicious script to a victim and convincing the victim to send the script to the vulnerable web application. The most common method of this is through a phishing email where the adversary embeds the malicious script with a URL that the victim then clicks on. In processing the subsequent request， the vulnerable web application incorrectly considers the malicious script as valid input and uses it to creates a reposnse that is then sent back to the victim. To launch a successful Reflected XSS attack， an adversary looks for places where user-input is used directly in the generation of a response. This often involves elements that are not expected to host scripts such as image tags (<img>)， or the addition of event attibutes such as onload and onmouseover. These elements are often not subject to the same input validation， output encoding， and other content filtering and checking routines.<PlainLiteral>

Such exploitation can lead to the complete subversion of any trust the target system may have in the identity of any entity with which it interacts， or the complete subversion of any control the target has over its data or functionality. Weaknesses targeted by subversion of authorization controls are often due to three primary factors: 1) a fundamental dependence on authentication mechanisms being effective; 2) a lack of effective control over the separation of privilege between various entities; and 3) assumptions and over confidence in the strength or rigor of the implemented authorization mechanisms.<PlainLiteral>

#1176:12	a)分析和总结事件发生的原因
CAPEC-644	An adversary uses stolen hash values for a user's credentials (username and password) to access systems managed under the same credential framwork that leverage the Lan Man (LM) and/or NT Lan Man (NTLM) authentication protocols. When authenticating via LM or NTLM， the hashed credentials' associated plaintext credentials are not requried for successful authentication. Therefore， if an adversary can obtain the hashed credentials of a user， he can then pass these hash values to the server or service to authenticate without needing to brute-force the hashes to obtain their cleartext values. The adversary can then impersonate the user and laterally move within the network. This technique can be performed against any operating system which leverages the LM or NTLM protocols.<PlainLiteral>
CAPEC-533	An attacker introduces malicious code to the victim's system by altering the payload of a software update， allowing for additional compromise or site disruption at the victim location. These manual， or user-assisted attacks， vary from requiring the user to download and run an executable， to as streamlined as tricking the user to click a URL. Attacks which aim at penetrating a specific network infrastructure often rely upon secondary attack methods to achieve the desired impact. Spamming， for example， is a common method employed as an secondary attack vector. Thus the attacker has in his or her arsenal a choice of initial attack vectors ranging from traditional SMTP/POP/IMAP spamming and its varieties， to web-application mechanisms which commonly implement both chat and rich HTML messaging within the user interface.<PlainLiteral>

CAPEC-445	An adversary exploits a configuration management system so that malicious logic is inserted into a software products build， update or deployed environment. If an adversary can control the elements included in a product's configuration management for build they can potentially replace， modify or insert code files containing malicious logic. If an adversary can control elements of a product's ongoing operational configuration management baseline they can potentially force clients receiving updates from the system to install insecure software when receiving updates from the server. Configuration management servers operate on the basis of a client pool， instructing each client on which software to install. In some cases the configuration management server will automate the software installation process. A malicious insider or an adversary who has compromised the server can alter the software baseline that clients must install， allowing the adversary to compromise a large number of satellite machines using the configuration management system. If an adversary can control elements of a product's configuration management for its deployed environment they can potentially alter fundamental security properties of the system based on assumptions that secure configurations are in place.<PlainLiteral>
CAPEC-489	An adversary may execute a flooding attack using the SSL protocol with the intent to deny legitimate users access to a service by consuming all the available resources on the server side. These attacks take advantage of the asymmetric relationship between the processing power used by the client and the processing power used by the server to create a secure connection. In this manner the attacker can make a large number of HTTPS requests on a low provisioned machine to tie up a disproportionately large number of resources on the server. The clients then continue to keep renegotiating the SSL connection. When multiplied by a large number of attacking machines， this attack can result in a crash or loss of service to legitimate users.<PlainLiteral>

CAPEC-103	In a clickjacking attack the victim is tricked into unknowingly initiating some action in one system while interacting with the UI from a seemingly completely different system. While being logged in to some target system， the victim visits the adversary's malicious site which displays a UI that the victim wishes to interact with. In reality， the clickjacked page has a transparent layer above the visible UI with action controls that the adversary wishes the victim to execute. The victim clicks on buttons or other UI elements they see on the page which actually triggers the action controls in the transparent overlaying layer. Depending on what that action control is， the adversary may have just tricked the victim into executing some potentially privileged (and most certainly undesired) functionality in the target system to which the victim is authenticated. The basic problem here is that there is a dichotomy between what the victim thinks they are clicking on versus what they are actually clicking on.<PlainLiteral>

CAPEC-44	An attack of this type exploits a buffer overflow vulnerability in the handling of binary resources. Binary resources may include music files like MP3， image files like JPEG files， and any other binary file. These attacks may pass unnoticed to the client machine through normal usage of files， such as a browser loading a seemingly innocent JPEG file. This can allow the attacker access to the execution stack and execute arbitrary code in the target process. This attack pattern is a variant of standard buffer overflow attacks using an unexpected vector (binary files) to wrap its attack and open up a new attack vector. The attacker is required to either directly serve the binary content to the victim， or place it in a locale like a MP3 sharing application， for the victim to download. The attacker then is notified upon the download or otherwise locates the vulnerability opened up by the buffer overflow.<PlainLiteral>

CAPEC-433	An attacker utilizes a technique to insinuate commands to the subconscious mind of the target via communication patterns. The human buffer overflow methodology does not rely on over-stimulating the mind of the target， but rather embedding messages within communication that the mind of the listener assembles at a subconscious level. The human buffer-overflow method is similar to subconscious programming to the extent that messages are embedded within the message. The fundamental difference is that embedded messages have a complete semantic quality， rather than mere imagery， and the mind of the target tends to key off of particular dominant patterns. The remaining information， carefully structured， speaks directly to the subconscious with a subtle， indirect， command. The effect is to produce a pattern of thinking that the attacker has predetermined but is buried within the message and not overtly stated. Structuring a human 'buffer overflow' requires precise attention to detail and the use of information in a manner that distracts the conscious mind from the message the subconscious is receiving.<PlainLiteral>

CAPEC-72	This attack targets the encoding of the URL. An attacker can take advantage of the multiple way of encoding an URL and abuse the interpretation of the URL. An URL may contain special character that need special syntax handling in order to be interpreted. Special characters are represented using a percentage character followed by two digits representing the octet code of the original character (%HEX-CODE). For instance US-ASCII space character would be represented with %20. This is often referred as escaped ending or percent-encoding. Since the server decodes the URL from the requests， it may restrict the access to some URL paths by validating and filtering out the URL requests it received. An attacker will try to craft an URL with a sequence of special characters which once interpreted by the server will be equivalent to a forbidden URL. It can be difficult to protect against this attack since the URL can contain other format of encoding such as UTF-8 encoding， Unicode-encoding， etc. The attacker could also subvert the meaning of the URL string request by encoding the data being sent to the server through a GET request. For instance an attacker may subvert the meaning of parameters used in a SQL request and sent through the URL string (See Example section).<PlainLiteral>
CVE-2007-0491	PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in up.php in Sky GUNNING MySpeach 3.0.6 and earlier allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the my_ms[root] parameter, a different vector than CVE-2006-4630.

title_715	/第二级安全管理中心技术要求/自身安全要求/数据安全/
CAPEC-466	An attacker leverages a man in the middle attack in order to bypass the same origin policy protection in the victim's browser. This active man in the middle attack could be launched， for instance， when the victim is connected to a public WIFI hot spot. An attacker is able to intercept requests and responses between the victim's browser and some non-sensitive website that does not use TLS. For instance， the victim may be checking flight or weather information. When an attacker intercepts a response bound to the victim， an attacker adds an iFrame (which is possibly invisible) to the response referencing some domain with sensitive functionality and forwards the response to the victim. The victim's browser than automatically initiates an unauthorized request to the site with sensitive functionality. The same origin policy would prevent making these requests to a site other than the one from which the Java Script came， but the attacker once again uses active man in the middle to intercept these automatic requests and redirect them to the domain / service with sensitive functionality. Any persistent cookies that the victim has in his or her browser would be used for these unauthorized requests. The attacker thus actively directs the victim to a site with sensitive functionality. When the site with sensitive functionality responds back to the victim's request， an active man in the middle attacker intercepts these responses， injects his or her own malicious Java Script into these responses， and forwards to the victim's browser. In the victim's browser， that Java Script executes under the restrictions of the site with sensitive functionality and can essentially be used to continue to interact with the sensitive site. So an attacker can execute scripts within the victim's browser on any domains the attacker desires. The attacker is able to use this technique to steal cookies from the victim's browser for whatever site the attacker wants. This applies to both persistent cookies and HTTP only cookies (unlike traditional XSS attacks). An attacker is also able to use this technique to steal authentication credentials for sites that only encrypt the login form， but do not require a secure channel for the initial request to get to the page with the login form. Further the attacker is also able to steal any autocompletion information. This attack pattern can also be used to enable session fixation and cache poisoning attacks. Additional attacks can be enabled as well.<PlainLiteral>

CAPEC-301	An adversary uses full TCP connection attempts to determine if a port is open on the target system. The scanning process involves completing a 'three-way handshake' with a remote port， and reports the port as closed if the full handshake cannot be established. An advantage of TCP connect scanning is that it works against any TCP/IP stack. RFC 793 defines how TCP connections are established and torn down. TCP connect scanning commonly involves establishing a full connection， and then subsequently tearing it down， and therefore involves sending a significant number of packets to each port that is scanned. Compared to other types of scans， a TCP Connect scan is slow and methodical. This type of scanning causes considerable noise in system logs and can be spotted by IDS/IPS systems. TCP Connect scanning can detect when a port is open by completing the three-way handshake， but it cannot distinguish a port that is unfiltered with no service running on it from a port that is filtered by a firewall but contains an active service. Due to the significant volume of packets exchanged per port， TCP connect scanning can become very time consuming (performing a full TCP connect scan against a host can take multiple days). Generally， it is not used as a method for performing a comprehensive port scan， but is reserved for checking a short list of common ports.<PlainLiteral>

CVE-2005-0102	Integer overflow in camel-lock-helper in Evolution 2.0.2 and earlier allows local users or remote malicious POP3 servers to execute arbitrary code via a length value of -1, which leads to a zero byte memory allocation and a buffer overflow.
CAPEC-43	An attacker supplies the target software with input data that contains sequences of special characters designed to bypass input validation logic. This exploit relies on the target making multiples passes over the input data and processing a 'layer' of special characters with each pass. In this manner， the attacker can disguise input that would otherwise be rejected as invalid by concealing it with layers of special/escape characters that are stripped off by subsequent processing steps. The goal is to first discover cases where the input validation layer executes before one or more parsing layers. That is， user input may go through the following logic in an application: <parser1> --> <input validator> --> <parser2>. In such cases， the attacker will need to provide input that will pass through the input validator， but after passing through parser2， will be converted into something that the input validator was supposed to stop.<PlainLiteral>

CAPEC-125	An adversary consumes the resources of a target by rapidly engaging in a large number of interactions with the target. This type of attack generally exposes a weakness in rate limiting or flow. When successful this attack prevents legitimate users from accessing the service and can cause the target to crash. This attack differs from resource depletion through leaks or allocations in that the latter attacks do not rely on the volume of requests made to the target but instead focus on manipulation of the target's operations. The key factor in a flooding attack is the number of requests the adversary can make in a given period of time. The greater this number， the more likely an attack is to succeed against a given target.<PlainLiteral>

CVE-2019-5052	An exploitable integer overflow vulnerability exists when loading a PCX file in SDL2_image 2.0.4. A specially crafted file can cause an integer overflow, resulting in too little memory being allocated, which can lead to a buffer overflow and potential code execution. An attacker can provide a specially crafted image file to trigger this vulnerability.

CAPEC-132	An attacker positions a symbolic link in such a manner that the targeted user or application accesses the link's endpoint， assuming that it is accessing a file with the link's name. The endpoint file may be either output or input. If the file is output， the result is that the endpoint is modified， instead of a file at the intended location. Modifications to the endpoint file may include appending， overwriting， corrupting， changing permissions， or other modifications. In some variants of this attack the attacker may be able to control the change to a file while in other cases they cannot. The former is especially damaging since the attacker may be able to grant themselves increased privileges or insert false information， but the latter can also be damaging as it can expose sensitive information or corrupt or destroy vital system or application files. Alternatively， the endpoint file may serve as input to the targeted application. This can be used to feed malformed input into the target or to cause the target to process different information， possibly allowing the attacker to control the actions of the target or to cause the target to expose information to the attacker. Moreover， the actions taken on the endpoint file are undertaken with the permissions of the targeted user or application， which may exceed the permissions that the attacker would normally have.<PlainLiteral>

title_1127	"保障广大用户的利益。"""
CAPEC-64	This attack targets the encoding of the URL combined with the encoding of the slash characters. An attacker can take advantage of the multiple ways of encoding a URL and abuse the interpretation of the URL. A URL may contain special character that need special syntax handling in order to be interpreted. Special characters are represented using a percentage character followed by two digits representing the octet code of the original character (%HEX-CODE). For instance US-ASCII space character would be represented with %20. This is often referred as escaped ending or percent-encoding. Since the server decodes the URL from the requests， it may restrict the access to some URL paths by validating and filtering out the URL requests it received. An attacker will try to craft an URL with a sequence of special characters which once interpreted by the server will be equivalent to a forbidden URL. It can be difficult to protect against this attack since the URL can contain other format of encoding such as UTF-8 encoding， Unicode-encoding， etc.<PlainLiteral>

CVE-2017-8404	An issue was discovered on D-Link DCS-1130 devices. The device provides a user with the capability of setting a SMB folder for the video clippings recorded by the device. It seems that the POST parameters passed in this request (to test if email credentials and hostname sent to the device work properly) result in being passed as commands to a "system" API in the function and thus result in command injection on the device. If the firmware version is dissected using binwalk tool, we obtain a cramfs-root archive which contains the filesystem set up on the device that contains all the binaries. The library "libmailutils.so" is the one that has the vulnerable function "sub_1FC4" that receives the values sent by the POST request. If we open this binary in IDA-pro we will notice that this follows an ARM little endian format. The function sub_1FC4 in IDA pro is identified to be receiving the values sent in the POST request and the value set in POST parameter "receiver1" is extracted in function "sub_15AC" which is then passed to the vulnerable system API call. The vulnerable library function is accessed in "cgibox" binary at address 0x0008F598 which calls the "mailLoginTest" function in "libmailutils.so" binary as shown below which results in the vulnerable POST parameter being passed to the library which results in the command injection issue.

CVE-2019-14398	cPanel before 80.0.5 allows demo accounts to execute arbitrary code via ajax_maketext_syntax_util.pl (SEC-498).
CAPEC-11	An attack of this type exploits a Web server's decision to take action based on filename or file extension. Because different file types are handled by different server processes， misclassification may force the Web server to take unexpected action， or expected actions in an unexpected sequence. This may cause the server to exhaust resources， supply debug or system data to the attacker， or bind an attacker to a remote process. This type of vulnerability has been found in many widely used servers including IIS， Lotus Domino， and Orion. The attacker's job in this case is straightforward， standard communication protocols and methods are used and are generally appended with malicious information at the tail end of an otherwise legitimate request. The attack payload varies， but it could be special characters like a period or simply appending a tag that has a special meaning for operations on the server side like .jsp for a java application server. The essence of this attack is that the attacker deceives the server into executing functionality based on the name of the request， i.e. login.jsp， not the contents.<PlainLiteral>

CAPEC-179	An attacker is able to discover and query Micro-services at a web location and thereby expose the Micro-services to further exploitation by gathering information about their implementation and function. Micro-services in web pages allow portions of a page to connect to the server and update content without needing to cause the entire page to update. This allows user activity to change portions of the page more quickly without causing disruptions elsewhere. However， these micro-services may not be subject to the same level of security review as other forms of content. For example， a micro-service that posts requests to a server that are turned into SQL queries may not adequately protect against SQL-injection attacks. As a result， micro-services may provide another vector for a range of attacks. It should be emphasized that the presence of micro-services does not necessarily make a site vulnerable to attack， but they do provide additional complexity to a web page and therefore may contain vulnerabilities that support other attack patterns.<PlainLiteral>

CAPEC-206	The attacker extracts credentials used for code signing from a production environment and then uses these credentials to sign malicious content with the developer's key. Many developers use signing keys to sign code or hashes of code. When users or applications verify the signatures are accurate they are led to believe that the code came from the owner of the signing key and that the code has not been modified since the signature was applied. If the attacker has extracted the signing credentials then they can use those credentials to sign their own code bundles.

One example could be harvesting lists of usernames or userIDs for the purpose of sending spam messages to those users. One example of this type of attack involves the adversary creating an event within the sub-application. Assume the adversary hosts a 'virtual sale' of rare items. As other users enter the event， the attacker records via MITM proxy the user_ids and usernames of everyone who attends. The adversary would then be able to spam those users within the application using an automated script.<PlainLiteral>

CAPEC-198	An adversary distributes a link (or possibly some other query structure) with a request to a third party web server that is malformed and also contains a block of exploit code in order to have the exploit become live code in the resulting error page. When the third party web server receives the crafted request and notes the error it then creates an error message that echoes the malformed message， including the exploit. Doing this converts the exploit portion of the message into to valid language elements that are executed by the viewing browser. When a victim executes the query provided by the attacker the infected error message error message is returned including the exploit code which then runs in the victim's browser. XSS can result in execution of code as well as data leakage (e.g. session cookies can be sent to the attacker). This type of attack is especially dangerous since the exploit appears to come from the third party web server， who the victim may trust and hence be more vulnerable to deception.<PlainLiteral>

CAPEC-394	An attacker uses a Snap Gun， also known as a Pick Gun， to force the lock on a building or facility. A Pick Gun is a special type of lock picking instrument that works on similar principles as lock bumping. A snap gun is a hand-held device with an attached metal pick. The metal pick strikes the pins within the lock， transferring motion from the key pins to the driver pins and forcing the lock into momentary alignment. A standard lock is secured by a set of internal pins that prevent the device from turning. Spring loaded driver pins push down on the key pins. When the correct key is inserted， the ridges on the key push the key pins up and against the driver pins， causing correct alignment which allows the lock cylinder to rotate. A Snap Gun exploits this design by using a metal pin to strike all of the key pins at once， forcing the driver pins to shift into an unlocked position. Unlike bump keys or lock picks， a Snap Gun may damage the lock more easily， leaving evidence that the lock has been tampered with.<PlainLiteral>

CAPEC-113	An adversary manipulates the use or processing of an Application Programming Interface (API) resulting in an adverse impact upon the security of the system implementing the API. This can allow the adversary to execute functionality not intended by the API implementation， possibly compromising the system which integrates the API. API manipulation can take on a number of forms including forcing the unexpected use of an API， or the use of an API in an unintended way. For example， an adversary may make a request to an application that leverages a non-standard API that is known to incorrectly validate its data and thus it may be manipulated by supplying metacharacters or alternate encodings as input， resulting in any number of injection flaws， including SQL injection， cross-site scripting， or command execution. Another example could be API methods that should be disabled in a production application but were not， thus exposing dangerous functionality within a production environment.<PlainLiteral>

CAPEC-85	This attack utilizes the frequent client-server roundtrips in Ajax conversation to scan a system. While Ajax does not open up new vulnerabilities per se， it does optimize them from an attacker point of view. In many XSS attacks the attacker must get a 'hole in one' and successfully exploit the vulnerability on the victim side the first time， once the client is redirected the attacker has many chances to engage in follow on probes， but there is only one first chance. In a widely used web application this is not a major problem because 1 in a 1，000 is good enough in a widely used application. A common first step for an attacker is to footprint the environment to understand what attacks will work. Since footprinting relies on enumeration， the conversational pattern of rapid， multiple requests and responses that are typical in Ajax applications enable an attacker to look for many vulnerabilities， well-known ports， network locations and so on.<PlainLiteral>

CAPEC-159	An adversary exploits a weakness in the way an application searches for external libraries to manipulate the execution flow to point to an adversary supplied library or code base. This pattern of attack allows the adversary to compromise the application or server via the execution of unauthorized code. An application typically makes calls to functions that are a part of libraries external to the application. These libraries may be part of the operating system or they may be third party libraries. If an adversary can redirect an application's attempts to access these libraries to other libraries that the adversary supplies， the adversary will be able to force the targeted application to execute arbitrary code. This is especially dangerous if the targeted application has enhanced privileges. Access can be redirected through a number of techniques， including the use of symbolic links， search path modification， and relative path manipulation.<PlainLiteral>

CAPEC-464	An attacker creates a very persistent cookie that stays present even after the user thinks it has been removed. The cookie is stored on the victim's machine in over ten places to include: Standard HTTP Cookies， Local Shared Objects (Flash Cookies)， Silverlight Isolated Storage， Storing cookies in RGB values of auto-generated， force-cached， PNGs using HTML5 Canvas tag to read pixels (cookies) back out， Storing cookies in Web History， Storing cookies in HTTP ETags， Storing cookies in Web cache， window.name caching， Internet Explorer userData storage， HTML5 Session Storage， HTML5 Local Storage， HTML5 Global Storage， HTML5 Database Storage via SQLite， among others. When the victim clears the cookie cache via traditional means inside the browser， that operation removes the cookie from certain places but not others. The malicious code then replicates the cookie from all of the places where it was not deleted to all of the possible storage locations once again. So the victim again has the cookie in all of the original storage locations. In other words， failure to delete the cookie in even one location will result in the cookie's resurrection everywhere. The evercookie will also persist across different browsers because certain stores (e.g.， Local Shared Objects) are shared between different browsers.<PlainLiteral>

#1201:64	1)网站开发商，为云服务客户提供云计算平台上网站开发服务，负责网站的系统架构、Web安全功能设计、代码实现及源代码安全、软件部署安全等;
CAPEC-220	An adversary takes advantage of weaknesses in the protocol by which a client and server are communicating to perform unexpected actions. Communication protocols are necessary to transfer messages between client and server applications. Moreover， different protocols may be used for different types of interactions. For example， an authentication protocol might be used to establish the identities of the server and client while a separate messaging protocol might be used to exchange data. If there is a weakness in a protocol used by the client and server， an attacker might take advantage of this to perform various types of attacks. For example， if the attacker is able to manipulate an authentication protocol， the attacker may be able spoof other clients or servers. If the attacker is able to manipulate a messaging protocol， the may be able to read sensitive information or modify message contents. This attack is often made easier by the fact that many clients and servers support multiple protocols to perform similar roles. For example， a server might support several different authentication protocols in order to support a wide range of clients， including legacy clients. Some of the older protocols may have vulnerabilities that allow an attacker to manipulate client-server interactions.<PlainLiteral>

CAPEC-105	HTTP Request Splitting (also known as HTTP Request Smuggling) is an attack pattern where an attacker attempts to insert additional HTTP requests in the body of the original (enveloping) HTTP request in such a way that the browser interprets it as one request but the web server interprets it as two. There are several ways to perform HTTP request splitting attacks. One way is to include double Content-Length headers in the request to exploit the fact that the devices parsing the request may each use a different header. Another way is to submit an HTTP request with a 'Transfer Encoding: chunked' in the request header set with setRequestHeader to allow a payload in the HTTP Request that can be considered as another HTTP Request by a subsequent parsing entity. A third way is to use the 'Double CR in an HTTP header' technique. There are also a few less general techniques targeting specific parsing vulnerabilities in certain web servers.<PlainLiteral>

CVE-2019-4439	IBM Cloud Private 3.1.0, 3.1.1, and 3.1.2 does not invalidate session after logout which could allow a local user to impersonate another user on the system. IBM X-Force ID: 162949.
CAPEC-134	An attacker manipulates the headers and content of an email message by injecting data via the use of delimiter characters native to the protocol. Many applications allow users to send email messages by filling in fields. For example， a web site may have a link to 'share this site with a friend' where the user provides the recipient's email address and the web application fills out all the other fields， such as the subject and body. In this pattern， an attacker adds header and body information to an email message by injecting additional content in an input field used to construct a header of the mail message. This attack takes advantage of the fact that RFC 822 requires that headers in a mail message be separated by a carriage return. As a result， an attacker can inject new headers or content simply by adding a delimiting carriage return and then supplying the new heading and body information. This attack will not work if the user can only supply the message body since a carriage return in the body is treated as a normal character.<PlainLiteral>
CVE-2013-3178	Microsoft Silverlight 5 before 5.1.20513.0 does not properly initialize arrays, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference) via a crafted Silverlight application, aka "Null Pointer Vulnerability."

CAPEC-41	This type of attack involves an attacker leveraging meta-characters in email headers to inject improper behavior into email programs. Email software has become increasingly sophisticated and feature-rich. In addition， email applications are ubiquitous and connected directly to the Web making them ideal targets to launch and propagate attacks. As the user demand for new functionality in email applications grows， they become more like browsers with complex rendering and plug in routines. As more email functionality is included and abstracted from the user， this creates opportunities for attackers. Virtually all email applications do not list email header information by default， however the email header contains valuable attacker vectors for the attacker to exploit particularly if the behavior of the email client application is known. Meta-characters are hidden from the user， but can contain scripts， enumerations， probes， and other attacks against the user's system.<PlainLiteral>

Typical RFC 793 behavior specifies that when a TCP port is open， a host must respond to an incoming SYN 'synchronize' packet by completing stage two of the 'three-way handshake' - by sending an SYN/ACK in response. When a port is closed， RFC 793 behavior is to respond with a RST 'reset' packet. This behavior can be used to 'ping' a target to see if it is alive by sending a TCP SYN packet to a port and then looking for a RST or an ACK packet in response. Due to the different responses from open and closed ports， SYN packets can be used to determine the remote state of the port. A TCP SYN ping is also useful for discovering alive hosts protected by a stateful firewall. In cases where a specific firewall rule does not block access to a port， a SYN packet can pass through the firewall to the host and solicit a response from either an open or closed port. When a stateful firewall is present， SYN pings are preferable to ACK pings because a stateful firewall will typically drop all unsolicited ACK packets as they are not part of an existing or new connection. TCP SYN pings often fail when a stateless ACL or firewall is configured to blanket-filter incoming packets to a port. The firewall device will discard any SYN packets to a blocked port. Often， an adversary will alternate between SYN and ACK pings to discover if a host is alive.<PlainLiteral>

CAPEC-117	An adversary monitors data streams to or from the target for information gathering purposes. This attack may be undertaken to solely gather sensitive information or to support a further attack against the target. This attack pattern can involve sniffing network traffic as well as other types of data streams (e.g. radio). The adversary can attempt to initiate the establishment of a data stream， influence the nature of the data transmitted， or passively observe the communications as they unfold. In all variants of this attack， the adversary is not the intended recipient of the data stream. In contrast to other means of gathering information (e.g.， targeting data leaks)， the adversary must actively position himself so as to observe explicit data channels (e.g. network traffic) and read the content.<PlainLiteral>

CAPEC-391	An attacker uses techniques and methods to bypass physical security measures of a building or facility. Physical locks may range from traditional lock and key mechanisms， cable locks used to secure laptops or servers， locks on server cases， or other such devices. Techniques such as lock bumping， lock forcing via snap guns， or lock picking can be employed to bypass those locks and gain access to the facilities or devices they protect， although stealth， evidence of tampering， and the integrity of the lock following an attack， are considerations that may determine the method employed. Physical locks are limited by the complexity of the locking mechanism. While some locks may offer protections such as shock resistant foam to prevent bumping or lock forcing methods， many commonly employed locks offer no such countermeasures.<PlainLiteral>

CVE-2014-8296	Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Modal Frame API module 6.x-1.x before 6.x-1.9 for Drupal allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via unspecified vectors.
CAPEC-303	An adversary uses a TCP XMAS scan to determine if ports are closed on the target machine. This scan type is accomplished by sending TCP segments with the all flags sent in the packet header， generating packets that are illegal based on RFC 793. The RFC 793 expected behavior is that any TCP segment with an out-of-state Flag sent to an open port is discarded， whereas segments with out-of-state flags sent to closed ports should be handled with a RST in response. This behavior should allow an attacker to scan for closed ports by sending certain types of rule-breaking packets (out of sync or disallowed by the TCB) and detect closed ports via RST packets. In addition to its relative speed when compared with other types of scans， its major advantage is its ability to scan through stateless firewall or ACL filters. Such filters are configured to block access to ports usually by preventing SYN packets， thus stopping any attempt to 'build' a connection. XMAS packets， like out-of-state FIN or ACK packets， tend to pass through such devices undetected. Many operating systems， however， do not implement RFC 793 exactly and for this reason FIN scans do not work as expected against these devices. Some operating systems， like Microsoft Windows， send a RST packet in response to any out-of-sync (or malformed) TCP segments received by a listening socket (rather than dropping the packet via RFC 793)， thus preventing the adversary from distinguishing between open and closed ports. XMAS scans are limited by the range of platforms against which they work. Additionally， because open ports are inferred via no responses being generated， one cannot distinguish an open port from a filtered port without further analysis. For instance， XMAS scanning a system protected by a stateful firewall may indicate all ports being open. Because of their obvious rule-breaking nature， XMAS scans are flagged by almost all intrusion prevention or intrusion detection systems.<PlainLiteral>

#1180:63	设备存在后门：工业控制系统中关键设备存在后门，可能会导致非法窃取系统数据
CAPEC-66	This attack exploits target software that constructs SQL statements based on user input. An attacker crafts input strings so that when the target software constructs SQL statements based on the input， the resulting SQL statement performs actions other than those the application intended. SQL Injection results from failure of the application to appropriately validate input. When specially crafted user-controlled input consisting of SQL syntax is used without proper validation as part of SQL queries， it is possible to glean information from the database in ways not envisaged during application design. Depending upon the database and the design of the application， it may also be possible to leverage injection to have the database execute system-related commands of the attackers' choice. SQL Injection enables an attacker to talk directly to the database， thus bypassing the application completely. Successful injection can cause information disclosure as well as ability to add or modify data in the database.<PlainLiteral>

CAPEC-300	An adversary uses a combination of techniques to determine the state of the ports on a remote target. Any service or application available for TCP or UDP networking will have a port open for communications over the network. Although common services have assigned port numbers， services and applications can run on arbitrary ports. Additionally， port scanning is complicated by the potential for any machine to have up to 65535 possible UDP or TCP services. The goal of port scanning is often broader than identifying open ports， but also give the adversary information concerning the firewall configuration. Depending upon the method of scanning that is used， the process can be stealthy or more obtrusive， the latter being more easily detectable due to the volume of packets involved， anomalous packet traits， or system logging. Typical port scanning activity involves sending probes to a range of ports and observing the responses. There are four types of port status that this type of attack aims to identify: 1) Open Port: The port is open and a firewall does not block access to the port， 2) Closed Port: The port is closed (i.e. no service resides there) and a firewall does not block access to the port， 3) Filtered Port: A firewall or ACL rule is blocking access to the port in some manner， although the presence of a listening service on the port cannot be verified， and 4) Unfiltered Port: A firewall or ACL rule is not blocking access to the port， although the presence of a listening service on the port cannot be verified. For strategic purposes it is useful for an adversary to distinguish between an open port that is protected by a filter vs. a closed port that is not protected by a filter. Making these fine grained distinctions is impossible with certain scan types. A TCP connect scan， for instance， cannot distinguish a blocked port with an active service from a closed port that is not firewalled. Other scan types can only detect closed ports， while others cannot detect port state at all， only the presence or absence of filters. Collecting this type of information tells the adversary which ports can be attacked directly， which must be attacked with filter evasion techniques like fragmentation， source port scans， and which ports are unprotected (i.e. not firewalled) but aren't hosting a network service. An adversary often combines various techniques in order to gain a more complete picture of the firewall filtering mechanisms in place for a host.<PlainLiteral>

CAPEC-509	Through the exploitation of how service accounts leverage Kerberos authentication with Service Principal Names (SPNs)， the adversary obtains and subsequently cracks the hashed credentials of a service account target to exploit its privileges. The Kerberos authentication protocol centers around a ticketing system which is used to request/grant access to services and to then access the requested services. As an authenticated user， the adversary may request Active Directory and obtain a service ticket with portions encrypted via RC4 with the private key of the authenticated account. By extracting the local ticket and saving it disk， the adversary can brute force the hashed value to reveal the target account credentials.<PlainLiteral>

CAPEC-62	An attacker crafts malicious web links and distributes them (via web pages， email， etc.)， typically in a targeted manner， hoping to induce users to click on the link and execute the malicious action against some third-party application. If successful， the action embedded in the malicious link will be processed and accepted by the targeted application with the users' privilege level. This type of attack leverages the persistence and implicit trust placed in user session cookies by many web applications today. In such an architecture， once the user authenticates to an application and a session cookie is created on the user's system， all following transactions for that session are authenticated using that cookie including potential actions initiated by an attacker and simply 'riding' the existing session cookie.<PlainLiteral>

Common encodings include ISO-8859-1， UTF-7， and UTF-8. When an encoding is not specified， a downstream component may choose a different encoding， either by assuming a default encoding or automatically inferring which encoding is being used， which can be erroneous. When the encodings are inconsistent， the downstream component might treat some character or byte sequences as special， even if they are not special in the original encoding.

CVE-2017-11072	In Android for MSM, Firefox OS for MSM, QRD Android, with all Android releases from CAF using the Linux kernel, while calculating CRC for GPT header fields with partition entries greater than 16384 buffer overflow occurs.
CAPEC-34	This attack uses a maliciously-crafted HTTP request in order to cause a vulnerable web server to respond with an HTTP response stream that will be interpreted by the client as two separate responses instead of one. This is possible when user-controlled input is used unvalidated as part of the response headers. The target software， the client， will interpret the injected header as being a response to a second request， thereby causing the maliciously-crafted contents be displayed and possibly cached.<PlainLiteral>

CAPEC-230	Applications often need to transform data in and out of the XML format by using an XML parser. It may be possible for an attacker to inject data that may have an adverse effect on the XML parser when it is being processed. By nesting XML data and causing this data to be continuously self-referential， an attacker can cause the XML parser to consume more resources while processing， causing excessive memory consumption and CPU utilization. An attacker's goal is to leverage parser failure to his or her advantage. In most cases this type of an attack will result in a denial of service due to an application becoming unstable， freezing， or crash. However it may be possible to cause a crash resulting in arbitrary code execution， leading to a jump from the data plane to the control plane [R.230.1].<PlainLiteral>

CVE-2019-12840	In Webmin through 1.910, any user authorized to the "Package Updates" module can execute arbitrary commands with root privileges via the data parameter to update.cgi.
CAPEC-23	An attack of this type exploits the host's trust in executing remote content， including binary files. The files are poisoned with a malicious payload (targeting the file systems accessible by the target software) by the adversary and may be passed through standard channels such as via email， and standard web content like PDF and multimedia files. The adversary exploits known vulnerabilities or handling routines in the target processes. Vulnerabilities of this type have been found in a wide variety of commercial applications from Microsoft Office to Adobe Acrobat and Apple Safari web browser. When the adversary knows the standard handling routines and can identify vulnerabilities and entry points， they can be exploited by otherwise seemingly normal content. Once the attack is executed， the adversary's program can access relative directories such as C:\\Program Files or other standard system directories to launch further attacks. In a worst case scenario， these programs are combined with other propagation logic and work as a virus.<PlainLiteral>

CVE-2017-10723	Recently it was discovered as a part of the research on IoT devices in the most recent firmware for Shekar Endoscope that an attacker connected to the device Wi-Fi SSID can exploit a memory corruption issue and execute remote code on the device. This device acts as an Endoscope camera that allows its users to use it in various industrial systems and settings, car garages, and also in some cases in the medical clinics to get access to areas that are difficult for a human being to reach. Any breach of this system can allow an attacker to get access to video feed and pictures viewed by that user and might allow them to get a foot hold in air gapped networks especially in case of nation critical infrastructure/industries. The firmware contains binary uvc_stream that is the UDP daemon which is responsible for handling all the UDP requests that the device receives. The client application sends a UDP request to change the Wi-Fi name which contains the following format: "SETCMD0001+0001+[2 byte length of wifiname]+[Wifiname]. This request is handled by "control_Dev_thread" function which at address "0x00409AE0" compares the incoming request and determines if the 10th byte is 01 and if it is then it redirects to 0x0040A74C which calls the function "setwifiname". The function "setwifiname" uses a memcpy function but uses the length of the payload obtained by using strlen function as the third parameter which is the number of bytes to copy and this allows an attacker to overflow the function and control the $PC value.
CVE-2018-10239	A privilege escalation vulnerability in the "support access" feature on Infoblox NIOS 6.8 through 8.4.1 could allow a locally authenticated administrator to temporarily gain additional privileges on an affected device and perform actions within the super user scope. The vulnerability is due to a weakness in the "support access" password generation algorithm. A locally authenticated administrative user may be able to exploit this vulnerability if the "support access" feature is enabled, they know the support access code for the current session, and they know the algorithm to generate the support access password from the support access code. "Support access" is disabled by default. When enabled, the access will be automatically disabled (and support access code will expire) after the 24 hours.

CAPEC-604	In this attack scenario， the attacker actively transmits on the Wi-Fi channel to prevent users from transmitting or receiving data from the targeted Wi-Fi network. There are several known techniques to perform this attack 鈥?for example: the attacker may flood the Wi-Fi access point (e.g. the retransmission device) with deauthentication frames. Another method is to transmit high levels of noise on the RF band used by the Wi-Fi network.<PlainLiteral>

#1213:9	威胁源是产生威胁主体。在进行威胁调查时，首要应识别存在哪些威胁源，同时分析这些威胁源的动机和能力。根据威胁源的不同，可以将威胁分为非人为的和人为的。对信息系统非人为的安全威胁主要是自然灾难。典型的自然灾难包括:水灾、台风、地震、雷击、坍塌、火灾、恐怖袭击、战争等。自然灾难可能会对信息系统造成毁灭性的破坏。另外，由于技术的局限性，造成系统不稳定，不可靠等情况，也会引发安全事件，这也是非人为的安全威胁。人为的安全威胁是指某些个人和组织对信息系统造成的安全威胁。人为的安全威胁主体可以来自组织内部，也可以来自组织外部。从威胁动机来看，人为的安全威胁又可细分为非恶意行为和恶意攻击行为。非恶意行为主要包括粗心或未受到良好培训的管理员和用户，由于特殊原因而导致的无意行为，造成对信息系统的破坏。恶意攻击是指出于各种目的而对信息系统实施的攻击。恶意攻击具有明显的目的性，一般经过精心策略和准备，并可能是有组织的，并投入一定的资源和时间。不同的危险源具有不同的攻击能力，攻击者的能力越强，攻击成功的可能性就越大。衡量攻击能力主要包括:施展攻击的知识、技能经验和必要的资金人力和技术资源等。a)恶意员工具有的知识和技能一般非常有限，攻击能力较弱，但恶意员工可能掌握关于系统的大量信息，并具有一定的权限，而且比外部的攻击者有更多的攻击机会，攻击的成功率高，属于比较严重的安全威胁;b)独立黑客是个体攻击者，可利用资源有限，主要采用外部攻击方式，通常发动零散的、无目的的攻击，攻击能力有限;c)国内外竟争者、犯罪团伙和恐怖组织是有组织攻击者，具有一.定的资源保障，具有较强的协作能力和计算能力，攻击目的性强，可进行长期深入的攻击准备，并能够采取外部攻击、内部攻击和邻近攻击相结合的攻击方式，甚至进行简单的分发攻击方式，攻击能力很强。来自国家行为的攻击是能力最强的攻击，国家攻击行为不仅组织严密，具有充足资金、人力和技术资源，而且可能在必要时实施高隐敝性和高破坏性的分发攻击，窃取组织核心机密或使网络和信息系统全面擁痪。表3分析了典型的攻击者类型、动机和特点。在识别威胁源时，一方面要调查存在哪些威胁源，特别要了解组织的客户、伙伴或竞争对手以及系统用户等情况;另一方面要调查不同威胁源的动机、特点、发动威胁的能力等。通过威胁源的分析，识别出威胁源名称、类型(包括自然环境、系统缺陷、政府.组织、职业个人等)、动机(非人为、人为非故意、人为故意等)。

CVE-2019-0305	Java Server Pages (JSPs) provided by the SAP NetWeaver Process Integration (SAP_XIESR and SAP_XITOOL: 7.10 to 7.11, 7.20, 7.30, 7.31, 7.40, 7.50) do not restrict or incorrectly restrict frame objects or UI layers that belong to another application or domain, resulting in Clickjacking vulnerability. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability leads to unwanted modification of user's data.
CVE-2017-1000121	The UNIX IPC layer in WebKit, including WebKitGTK+ prior to 2.16.3, does not properly validate message size metadata, allowing a compromised secondary process to trigger an integer overflow and subsequent buffer overflow in the UI process. This vulnerability does not affect Apple products.
#1167:68	a)要求信息系统、组件或服务的开发商制定明确的开发规范，在规范中明确以下事项:  1)所开发系统的安全需求;  2)开发过程中使用的标准和工具;  3)开发过程中使用的特定工具选项和工具配置。

CVE-2005-2506	Algorithmic complexity vulnerability in CoreFoundation in Mac OS X 10.3.9 and 10.4.2 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via crafted Gregorian dates.
CWE-407	An algorithm in a product has an inefficient worst-case computational complexity that may be detrimental to system performance and can be triggered by an attacker， typically using crafted manipulations that ensure that the worst case is being reached.<PlainLiteral>
CVE-2013-6821	Directory traversal vulnerability in the Exportability Check Service in SAP NetWeaver allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files via unspecified vectors.
CVE-2006-0963	Multiple buffer overflows in STLport 5.0.2 might allow local users to execute arbitrary code via (1) long locale environment variables to a strcpy function call in c_locale_glibc2.c and (2) long arguments to unspecified functions in num_put_float.cpp.
CVE-2006-4068	The pswd.js script relies on the client to calculate whether a username and password match hard-coded hashed values for a server, and uses a hashing scheme that creates a large number of collisions, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct offline brute force attacks.  NOTE: this script might also allow attackers to generate the server-side "secret" URL without determining the original password, but this possibility was not discussed by the original researcher.
CWE-328	The product uses a hashing algorithm that produces a hash value that can be used to determine the original input， or to find an input that can produce the same hash， more efficiently than brute force techniques. This weakness is especially dangerous when the hash is used in security algorithms that require the one-way property to hold. For example， if an authentication system takes an incoming password and generates a hash， then compares the hash to another hash that it has stored in its authentication database， then the ability to create a collision could allow an attacker to provide an alternate password that produces the same target hash， bypassing authentication.<PlainLiteral>
CVE-2012-2785	Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities in libavcodec/wmalosslessdec.c in FFmpeg before 0.11 have unknown impact and attack vectors, related to (1) "some subframes only encode some channels" or (2) a large order value.

CVE-2017-1002016	Vulnerability in wordpress plugin flickr-picture-backup v0.7， The code in flickr-picture-download.php doesn't check to see if the user is authenticated or that they have permission to upload files.<PlainLiteral>
CAPEC-407	An adversary engages in pretexting behavior to solicit information from target persons， or manipulate the target into performing some action that serves the adversary's interests. During a pretexting attack， the adversary creates an invented scenario， assuming an identity or role to persuade a targeted victim to release information or perform some action. It is more than just creating a lie; in some cases it can be creating a whole new identity and then using that identity to manipulate the receipt of information. Pretexting can also be used to impersonate people in certain jobs and roles that they never themselves have done. In simple form， these attacks can be leveraged to learn information about a target. More complicated iterations may seek to solicit a target to perform some action that assists the adversary in exploiting organizational weaknesses or obtaining access to secure facilities or systems. Pretexting is not a one-size fits all solution. Good information gathering techniques can make or break a good pretext. A solid pretext is an essential part of building trust. If an adversary鈥檚 alias， story， or identity has holes or lacks credibility or even the perception of credibility the target will most likely catch on.<PlainLiteral>

DetectionMethod-CWE-798-8d0aa804-5c79-4cf4-9c03-e81c4c2728d1	Automated white box techniques have been published for detecting hard-coded credentials for incoming authentication， but there is some expert disagreement regarding their effectiveness and applicability to a broad range of methods.<PlainLiteral>
CAPEC-191	An adversary engages in activities to discover any sensitive strings are present within the compiled code of an executable， such as literal ASCII strings within the file itself， or possibly strings hard-coded into particular routines that can be revealed by code refactoring methods including static and dynamic analysis. One specific example of a sensitive string is a hard-coded password. Typical examples of software with hard-coded passwords include server-side executables which may check for a hard-coded password or key during a user's authentication with the server. Hard-coded passwords can also be present in client-side executables which utilize the password or key when connecting to either a remote component， such as a database server， licensing server， or otherwise， or a processes on the same host that expects a key or password. When analyzing an executable the adversary may search for the presence of such strings by analyzing the byte-code of the file itself. Example utilities for revealing strings within a file include 'strings，' 'grep，' or other variants of these programs depending upon the type of operating system used. These programs can be used to dump any ASCII or UNICODE strings contained within a program. Strings can also be searched for using a hex editors by loading the binary or object code file and utilizing native search functions such as regular expressions.<PlainLiteral>

CAPEC-161	An attacker exploits characteristics of the infrastructure of a network entity in order to perpetrate attacks or information gathering on network objects or effect a change in the ordinary information flow between network objects. Most often， this involves manipulation of the routing of network messages so， instead of arriving at their proper destination， they are directed towards an entity of the attackers' choosing， usually a server controlled by the attacker. The victim is often unaware that their messages are not being processed correctly.

CAPEC-399	An attacker analyzes data returned by an RFID chip and uses this information to duplicate a RFID signal that responds identically to the target chip. In some cases RFID chips are used for building access control， employee identification， or as markers on products being delivered along a supply chain. Some organizations also embed RFID tags inside computer assets to trigger alarms if they are removed from particular rooms， zones， or buildings. Similar to Magnetic strip cards， RFID cards are susceptible to duplication (cloning) and reuse. RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) are passive devices which consist of an integrated circuit for processing RF signals and an antenna. RFID devices are passive in that they lack an on on-board power source. The majority of RFID chips operate on either the 13.56 MHz or 135 KHz frequency. The chip is powered when a signal is received by the antenna on the chip， powering the chip long enough to send a reply message. An attacker is able to capture and analyze RFID data by either stimulating the chip to respond or being proximate to the chip when it sends a response to a remote transmitter. This allows the attacker to duplicate the signal and conduct attacks such as gaining unauthorized access to a building or impersonating a user's identification..<PlainLiteral>

CVE-2018-6599	An issue was discovered on Orbic Wonder Orbic/RC555L/RC555L:7.1.2/N2G47H/329100b:user/release-keys devices, allowing attackers to obtain sensitive information (such as text-message content) by reading a copy of the Android log on the SD card. The system-wide Android logs are not directly available to third-party apps since they tend to contain sensitive data. Third-party apps can read from the log but only the log messages that the app itself has written. Certain apps can leak data to the Android log due to not sanitizing log messages, which is in an insecure programming practice. Pre-installed system apps and apps that are signed with the framework key can read from the system-wide Android log. We found a pre-installed app on the Orbic Wonder that when started via an Intent will write the Android log to the SD card, also known as external storage, via com.ckt.mmitest.MmiMainActivity. Any app that requests the READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission can read from the SD card. Therefore, a local app on the device can quickly start a specific component in the pre-installed system app to have the Android log written to the SD card. Therefore, any app co-located on the device with the READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission can obtain the data contained within the Android log and continually monitor it and mine the log for relevant data. In addition, the default messaging app (com.android.mms) writes the body of sent and received text messages to the Android log, as well as the recipient phone number for sent text messages and the sending phone number for received text messages. In addition, any call data contains phone numbers for sent and received calls.

CAPEC-397	An attacker duplicates the data on a Magnetic strip card (i.e. 'swipe card' or 'magstripe') to gain unauthorized access to a physical location or a person's private information. Magstripe cards encode data on a band of iron-based magnetic particles arrayed in a stripe along a rectangular card. Most magstripe card data formats conform to ISO standards 7810， 7811， 7813， 8583， and 4909. The primary advantage of magstripe technology is ease of encoding and portability， but this also renders magnetic strip cards susceptible to unauthorized duplication. If magstripe cards are used for access control， all an attacker need do is obtain a valid card long enough to make a copy of the card and then return the card to its location (i.e. a co-worker's desk). Magstripe reader/writers are widely available as well as software for analyzing data encoded on the cards. By swiping a valid card， it becomes trivial to make any number of duplicates that function as the original.<PlainLiteral>

CAPEC-495	An attacker may execute a UDP Fragmentation attack against a target server in an attempt to consume resources such as bandwidth and CPU. IP fragmentation occurs when an IP datagram is larger than the MTU of the route the datagram has to traverse. Typically the attacker will use large UDP packets over 1500 bytes of data which forces fragmentation as ethernet MTU is 1500 bytes. This attack is a variation on a typical UDP flood but it enables more network bandwidth to be consumed with fewer packets. Additionally it has the potential to consume server CPU resources and fill memory buffers associated with the processing and reassembling of fragmented packets.<PlainLiteral>

CAPEC-332	An adversary sends a UDP datagram having an assigned value to its internet identification field (ID) to a closed port on a target to observe the manner in which this bit is echoed back in the ICMP error message. The internet identification field (ID) is typically utilized for reassembling a fragmented packet. RFC791 and RFC815 discusses about IP datagrams， fragmentation and reassembly. Some operating systems or router firmware reverse the bit order of the ID field when echoing the IP Header portion of the original datagram within the ICMP error message. There are three behaviors related to the IP ID field that can be used to distinguish remote operating systems or firmware: 1) it is echoed back identically to the bit order of the ID field in the original IP header， 2) it is echoed back， but the byte order has been reversed， or it contains an incorrect or unexpected value. Different operating systems will respond by setting the IP ID field differently within error messaging. This allows the attacker to construct a fingerprint of specific OS behaviors.<PlainLiteral>

CAPEC-231	Applications often need to transform data in and out of the XML format by using an XML parser. It may be possible for an attacker to inject data that may have an adverse effect on the XML parser when it is being processed. By supplying oversized payloads in input vectors that will be processed by the XML parser， an attacker can cause the XML parser to consume more resources while processing， causing excessive memory consumption and CPU utilization， and potentially cause execution of arbitrary code. An attacker's goal is to leverage parser failure to his or her advantage. In many cases this type of an attack will result in a denial of service due to an application becoming unstable， freezing， or crash. However it is possible to cause a crash resulting in arbitrary code execution， leading to a jump from the data plane to the control plane [R.231.1].<PlainLiteral>

CAPEC-150	An adversary exploits well-known locations for resources for the purposes of undermining the security of the target. In many， if not most systems， files and resources are organized in a default tree structure. This can be useful for adversaries because they often know where to look for resources or files that are necessary for attacks. Even when the precise location of a targeted resource may not be known， naming conventions may indicate a small area of the target machine's file tree where the resources are typically located. For example， configuration files are normally stored in the /etc director on Unix systems. Adversaries can take advantage of this to commit other types of attacks.<PlainLiteral>

CVE-2019-1928	Multiple vulnerabilities in Cisco Webex Network Recording Player for Microsoft Windows and Cisco Webex Player for Microsoft Windows could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected system. The vulnerabilities exist because the affected software improperly validates Advanced Recording Format (ARF) and Webex Recording Format (WRF) files. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a user a malicious ARF or WRF file through a link or email attachment and persuading the user to open the file with the affected software on the local system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system with the privileges of the targeted user.
CAPEC-136	An attacker manipulates or crafts an LDAP query for the purpose of undermining the security of the target. Some applications use user input to create LDAP queries that are processed by an LDAP server. For example， a user might provide their username during authentication and the username might be inserted in an LDAP query during the authentication process. An attacker could use this input to inject additional commands into an LDAP query that could disclose sensitive information. For example， entering a * in the aforementioned query might return information about all users on the system. This attack is very similar to an SQL injection attack in that it manipulates a query to gather additional information or coerce a particular return value.<PlainLiteral>

CVE-2017-8410	An issue was discovered on D-Link DCS-1100 and DCS-1130 devices. The binary rtspd in /sbin folder of the device handles all the rtsp connections received by the device. It seems that the binary performs a memcpy operation at address 0x00011E34 with the value sent in the "Authorization: Basic" RTSP header and stores it on the stack. The number of bytes to be copied are calculated based on the length of the string sent in the RTSP header by the client. As a result, memcpy copies more data then it can hold on stack and this results in corrupting the registers for the caller function sub_F6CC which results in memory corruption. The severity of this attack is enlarged by the fact that the same value is then copied on the stack in the function 0x00011378 and this allows to overflow the buffer allocated and thus control the PC register which will result in arbitrary code execution on the device.
CVE-2019-10721	BlogEngine.NET 3.3.7.0 allows a Client Side URL Redirect via the ReturnUrl parameter, related to BlogEngine/BlogEngine.Core/Services/Security/Security.cs, login.aspx, and register.aspx.

This allows attackers to overwrite arbitrary files in scenarios where an intermediate analysis result is archived for sharing with other persons. To achieve arbitrary code execution, one approach is to overwrite some critical Ghidra modules, e.g., the decompile module.
CVE-2019-10160	A security regression of CVE-2019-9636 was discovered in python since commit d537ab0ff9767ef024f26246899728f0116b1ec3 affecting versions 2.7, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7 and from v3.8.0a4 through v3.8.0b1, which still allows an attacker to exploit CVE-2019-9636 by abusing the user and password parts of a URL. When an application parses user-supplied URLs to store cookies, authentication credentials, or other kind of information, it is possible for an attacker to provide specially crafted URLs to make the application locate host-related information (e.g. cookies, authentication data) and send them to a different host than where it should, unlike if the URLs had been correctly parsed. The result of an attack may vary based on the application.

CAPEC-94	This type of attack targets the communication between two components (typically client and server). The attacker places himself in the communication channel between the two components. Whenever one component attempts to communicate with the other (data flow， authentication challenges， etc.)， the data first goes to the attacker， who has the opportunity to observe or alter it， and it is then passed on to the other component as if it was never intercepted. This interposition is transparent leaving the two compromised components unaware of the potential corruption or leakage of their communications. The potential for Man-in-the-Middle attacks yields an implicit lack of trust in communication or identify between two components.<PlainLiteral>

While the US infrastructure proper may not contain widespread vulnerabilities to this type of attack， many companies are connected globally through call centers and business process outsourcing. These international systems may be operated in countries which have not upgraded Telco infrastructure and so are vulnerable to Blue boxing. Blue boxing is a result of failure on the part of the system to enforce strong authorization for administrative functions. While the infrastructure is different than standard current applications like web applications， there are historical lessons to be learned to upgrade the access control for administrative functions.<PlainLiteral>

CAPEC-313	An adversary engages in activity to detect the version or type of OS software in a an environment by passively monitoring communication between devices， nodes， or applications. Passive techniques for operating system detection send no actual probes to a target， but monitor network or client-server communication between nodes in order to identify operating systems based on observed behavior as compared to a database of known signatures or values. While passive OS fingerprinting is not usually as reliable as active methods， it is generally better able to evade detection.<PlainLiteral>
CAPEC-160	Some APIs support scripting instructions as arguments. Methods that take scripted instructions (or references to scripted instructions) can be very flexible and powerful. However， if an attacker can specify the script that serves as input to these methods they can gain access to a great deal of functionality. For example， HTML pages support <script> tags that allow scripting languages to be embedded in the page and then interpreted by the receiving web browser. If the content provider is malicious， these scripts can compromise the client application. Some applications may even execute the scripts under their own identity (rather than the identity of the user providing the script) which can allow attackers to perform activities that would otherwise be denied to them.<PlainLiteral>

Easily exploitable vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with logon to the infrastructure where Oracle VM VirtualBox executes to compromise Oracle VM VirtualBox. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker and while the vulnerability is in Oracle VM VirtualBox, attacks may significantly impact additional products. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in takeover of Oracle VM VirtualBox. CVSS 3.0 Base Score 8.6 (Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability impacts). CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H).
CVE-2017-8227	Amcrest IPM-721S V2.420.AC00.16.R.20160909 devices have a timeout policy to wait for 5 minutes in case 30 incorrect password attempts are detected using the Web and HTTP API interface provided by the device. However, if the same brute force attempt is performed using the ONVIF specification (which is supported by the same binary) then there is no account lockout or timeout executed. This can allow an attacker to circumvent the account protection mechanism and brute force the credentials. If the firmware version V2.420.AC00.16.R 9/9/2016 is dissected using binwalk tool, one obtains a _user-x.squashfs.img.extracted archive which contains the filesystem set up on the device that many of the binaries in the /usr folder. The binary "sonia" is the one that has the vulnerable function that performs the credential check in the binary for the ONVIF specification. If one opens this binary in IDA-pro one will notice that this follows a ARM little endian format. The function at address 00671618 in IDA pro is parses the WSSE security token header. The sub_ 603D8 then performs the authentication check and if it is incorrect passes to the function sub_59F4C which prints the value "Sender not authorized."

CAPEC-156	Attack patterns within this category focus on malicious interactions with a target in an attempt to deceive the target and convince the target that it is interacting with some other principal and as such take actions based on the level of trust that exists between the target and the other principal. These types of attacks assume that some piece of content or functionality is associated with an identity and that the content / functionality is trusted by the target because of this association. Often identified by the term 'spoofing'， these types of attacks rely on the falsification of the content and/or identity in such a way that the target will incorrectly trust the legitimacy of the content. For example， an attacker may modify a financial transaction between two parties so that the participants remain unchanged but the amount of the transaction is increased. If the recipient cannot detect the change， they may incorrectly assume the modified message originated with the original sender. Attacks of these type may involve an adversary crafting the content from scratch or capturing and modifying legitimate content.<PlainLiteral>

CVE-2019-8323	An issue was discovered in RubyGems 2.6 and later through 3.0.2. Gem::GemcutterUtilities#with_response may output the API response to stdout as it is. Therefore, if the API side modifies the response, escape sequence injection may occur.
CVE-2017-11580	Blipcare Wifi blood pressure monitor BP700 10.1 devices allow memory corruption that results in Denial of Service. When connected to the "Blip" open wireless connection provided by the device, if a large string is sent as a part of the HTTP request in any part of the HTTP headers, the device could become completely unresponsive. Presumably this happens as the memory footprint provided to this device is very small. According to the specs from Rezolt, the Wi-Fi module only has 256k of memory. As a result, an incorrect string copy operation using either memcpy, strcpy, or any of their other variants could result in filling up the memory space allocated to the function executing and this would result in memory corruption. To test the theory, one can modify the demo application provided by the Cypress WICED SDK and introduce an incorrect "memcpy" operation and use the compiled application on the evaluation board provided by Cypress semiconductors with exactly the same Wi-Fi SOC. The results were identical where the device would completely stop responding to any of the ping or web requests.

The vulnerability can be exercised on the local intranet or remotely if remote administration is enabled.
CAPEC-170	An attacker sends a series of probes to a web application in order to elicit version-dependent and type-dependent behavior that assists in identifying the target. An attacker could learn information such as software versions， error pages， and response headers， variations in implementations of the HTTP protocol， directory structures， and other similar information about the targeted service. This information can then be used by an attacker to formulate a targeted attack plan. While web application fingerprinting is not intended to be damaging (although certain activities， such as network scans， can sometimes cause disruptions to vulnerable applications inadvertently) it may often pave the way for more damaging attacks.<PlainLiteral>
CAPEC-571	An adversary may attempt to block indicators from leaving the host machine. In the case of network based reporting of indicators， an adversary may block traffic associated with reporting to prevent central station analysis. This may be accomplished by many means such as stopping a local process to creating a host-based firewall rule to block traffic to a specific server.<PlainLiteral>

CVE-2018-1000005	libcurl 7.49.0 to and including 7.57.0 contains an out bounds read in code handling HTTP/2 trailers. It was reported (https://github.com/curl/curl/pull/2231) that reading an HTTP/2 trailer could mess up future trailers since the stored size was one byte less than required. The problem is that the code that creates HTTP/1-like headers from the HTTP/2 trailer data once appended a string like `:` to the target buffer, while this was recently changed to `: ` (a space was added after the colon) but the following math wasn't updated correspondingly. When accessed, the data is read out of bounds and causes either a crash or that the (too large) data gets passed to client write. This could lead to a denial-of-service situation or an information disclosure if someone has a service that echoes back or uses the trailers for something.

CAPEC-95	This attack targets the WSDL interface made available by a web service. The attacker may scan the WSDL interface to reveal sensitive information about invocation patterns， underlying technology implementations and associated vulnerabilities. This type of probing is carried out to perform more serious attacks (e.g. parameter tampering， malicious content injection， command injection， etc.). WSDL files provide detailed information about the services ports and bindings available to consumers. For instance， the attacker can submit special characters or malicious content to the Web service and can cause a denial of service condition or illegal access to database records. In addition， the attacker may try to guess other private methods by using the information provided in the WSDL files.<PlainLiteral>
CAPEC-234	An attacker gains control of a process that is assigned elevated privileges in order to execute arbitrary code with those privileges. Some processes are assigned elevated privileges on an operating system， usually through association with a particular user， group， or role. If an attacker can hijack this process， they will be able to assume its level of privilege in order to execute their own code. Processes can be hijacked through improper handling of user input (for example， a buffer overflow or certain types of injection attacks) or by utilizing system utilities that support process control that have been inadequately secured.<PlainLiteral>

CVE-2017-8406	An issue was discovered on D-Link DCS-1130 devices. The device provides a crossdomain.xml file with no restrictions on who can access the webserver. This allows an hosted flash file on any domain to make calls to the device's webserver and pull any information that is stored on the device. In this case, user's credentials are stored in clear text on the device and can be pulled easily. It also seems that the device does not implement any cross-site scripting forgery protection mechanism which allows an attacker to trick a user who is logged in to the web management interface into executing a cross-site flashing attack on the user's browser and execute any action on the device provided by the web management interface which steals the credentials from tools_admin.cgi file's response and displays it inside a Textfield.

CVE-2006-3379	Algorithmic complexity vulnerability in Hiki Wiki 0.6.0 through 0.6.5 and 0.8.0 through 0.8.5 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) by performing a diff between large, crafted pages that trigger the worst case.
CAPEC-227	An adversary attempts to deny legitimate users access to a resource by continually engaging a specific resource in an attempt to keep the resource tied up as long as possible. The adversary's primary goal is not to crash or flood the target， which would alert defenders; rather it is to repeatedly perform actions or abuse algorithmic flaws such that a given resource is tied up and not available to a legitimate user. By carefully crafting a requests that keep the resource engaged through what is seemingly benign requests， legitimate users are limited or completely denied access to the resource. The degree to which the attack is successful depends upon the adversary's ability to sustain resource requests over time with a volume that exceeds the normal usage by legitimate users， as well as other mitigating circumstances such as the target's ability to shift load or acquire additional resources to deal with the depletion. This attack differs from a flooding attack as it is not entirely dependent upon large volumes of requests， and it differs from resource leak exposures which tend to exploit the surrounding environment needed for the resource to function. The key factor in a sustainment attack are the repeated requests that take longer to process than usual.<PlainLiteral>

CVE-2017-7613	elflint.c in elfutils 0.168 does not validate the number of sections and the number of segments, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via a crafted ELF file.
CWE-645	The software contains an account lockout protection mechanism， but the mechanism is too restrictive and can be triggered too easily， which allows attackers to deny service to legitimate users by causing their accounts to be locked out. Account lockout is a security feature often present in applications as a countermeasure to the brute force attack on the password based authentication mechanism of the system. After a certain number of failed login attempts， the users' account may be disabled for a certain period of time or until it is unlocked by an administrator. Other security events may also possibly trigger account lockout. However， an attacker may use this very security feature to deny service to legitimate system users. It is therefore important to ensure that the account lockout security mechanism is not overly restrictive.<PlainLiteral>

Spear Phishing is an enhanced version of the Phishing attack targeted to a specific user or group. The quality of the targeted email is usually enhanced by appearing to come from a known or trusted entity. If the email account of some trusted entity has been compromised the message may be digitally signed. The message will contain information specific to the targeted users that will enhance the probability that they will follow the URL to the compromised site. For example， the message may indicate knowledge of the targets employment， residence， interests， or other information that suggests familiarity. As soon as the user follows the instructions in the message， the attack proceeds as a standard Phishing attack.<PlainLiteral>

CAPEC-214	An attacker sends random， malformed， or otherwise unexpected messages to a target application and observes any stack traces produced by error messages. Fuzzing techniques involve sending random or malformed messages to a target and monitoring the target's response. The attacker does not initially know how a target will respond to individual messages but by attempting a large number of message variants they may find a variant that trigger's desired behavior. In this attack， the purpose of the fuzzing is to cause the targeted application to return an error including a stack trace， although fuzzing a target can also sometimes cause the target to enter an unstable state， causing a crash. The stack trace enumerates the chain of methods that led up to the point where the error was encountered. This can not only reveal the names of the methods (some of which may have known weaknesses) but possibly also the location of class files and libraries as well as parameter values. In some cases， the stack trace might even disclose sensitive configuration or user information.<PlainLiteral>

CAPEC-619	In this attack scenario， the attacker passively monitors the signal strength of the target鈥檚 cellular RF signal or WiFi RF signal and uses the strength of the signal (with directional antennas and/or from multiple listening points at once) to identify the source location of the signal. Obtaining the signal of the target can be accomplished through multiple techniques such as through Cellular Broadcast Message Request or through the use of IMSI Tracking or WiFi MAC Address Tracking.<PlainLiteral>

CAPEC-468	An attacker makes use of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) injection to steal data cross domain from the victim's browser. The attack works by abusing the standards relating to loading of CSS: 1. Send cookies on any load of CSS (including cross-domain) 2. When parsing returned CSS ignore all data that does not make sense before a valid CSS descriptor is found by the CSS parser By having control of some text in the victim's domain， the attacker is able to inject a seemingly valid CSS string. It does not matter if this CSS string is preceded by other data. The CSS parser will still locate the CSS string. If the attacker is able to control two injection points， one before the cross domain data that the attacker is interested in receiving and the other one after， the attacker can use this attack to steal all of the data in between these two CSS injection points when referencing the injected CSS while performing rendering on the site that the attacker controls. When rendering， the CSS parser will detect the valid CSS string to parse and ignore the data that 'does not make sense'. That data will simply be rendered. That data is in fact the data that the attacker just stole cross domain. The stolen data may contain sensitive information， such CSRF protection tokens.<PlainLiteral>

CVE-2014-2339	Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in bbs/ajax.autosave.php in GNUboard 5.x and possibly earlier allow remote authenticated users to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the (1) subject or (2) content parameter.
CAPEC-112	In this attack， some asset (information， functionality， identity， etc.) is protected by a finite secret value. The attacker attempts to gain access to this asset by using trial-and-error to exhaustively explore all the possible secret values in the hope of finding the secret (or a value that is functionally equivalent) that will unlock the asset. Examples of secrets can include， but are not limited to， passwords， encryption keys， database lookup keys， and initial values to one-way functions. The key factor in this attack is the attackers' ability to explore the possible secret space rapidly. This， in turn， is a function of the size of the secret space and the computational power the attacker is able to bring to bear on the problem. If the attacker has modest resources and the secret space is large， the challenge facing the attacker is intractable. While the defender cannot control the resources available to an attacker， they can control the size of the secret space. Creating a large secret space involves selecting one's secret from as large a field of equally likely alternative secrets as possible and ensuring that an attacker is unable to reduce the size of this field using available clues or cryptanalysis. Doing this is more difficult than it sounds since elimination of patterns (which， in turn， would provide an attacker clues that would help them reduce the space of potential secrets) is difficult to do using deterministic machines， such as computers. Assuming a finite secret space， a brute force attack will eventually succeed. The defender must rely on making sure that the time and resources necessary to do so will exceed the value of the information. For example， a secret space that will likely take hundreds of years to explore is likely safe from raw-brute force attacks.<PlainLiteral>

CVE-2019-3822	libcurl versions from 7.36.0 to before 7.64.0 are vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow. The function creating an outgoing NTLM type-3 header (`lib/vauth/ntlm.c:Curl_auth_create_ntlm_type3_message()`), generates the request HTTP header contents based on previously received data. The check that exists to prevent the local buffer from getting overflowed is implemented wrongly (using unsigned math) and as such it does not prevent the overflow from happening. This output data can grow larger than the local buffer if very large 'nt response' data is extracted from a previous NTLMv2 header provided by the malicious or broken HTTP server. Such a 'large value' needs to be around 1000 bytes or more. The actual payload data copied to the target buffer comes from the NTLMv2 type-2 response header.

CAPEC-152	Attack patterns within this category focus on the ability to control or disrupt the behavior of a target either through crafted data submitted via an interface for data input， or the installation and execution of malicious code on the target system. The former happens when an adversary adds material to their input that is interpreted by the application causing the targeted application to perform steps unintended by the application manager or causing the application to enter an unstable state. Attacks of this type differ from Data Structure Attacks in that the latter attacks subvert the underlying structures that hold user-provided data， either pre-empting interpretation of the input (in the case of Buffer Overflows) or resulting in values that the targeted application is unable to handle correctly (in the case of Integer Overflows). In Injection attacks， the input is interpreted by the application， but the attacker has included instructions to the interpreting functions that the target application then follows.<PlainLiteral>

CAPEC-321	This OS fingerprinting probe tests the target system's assignment of TCP sequence numbers. One common way to test TCP Sequence Number generation is to send a probe packet to an open port on the target and then compare the how the Sequence Number generated by the target relates to the Acknowledgement Number in the probe packet. Different operating systems assign Sequence Numbers differently， so a fingerprint of the operating system can be obtained by categorizing the relationship between the acknowledgement number and sequence number as follows: 1) the Sequence Number generated by the target is Zero， 2) the Sequence Number generated by the target is the same as the acknowledgement number in the probe， 3) the Sequence Number generated by the target is the acknowledgement number plus one， or 4) the Sequence Number is any other non-zero number.<PlainLiteral>

CWE-120	The program copies an input buffer to an output buffer without verifying that the size of the input buffer is less than the size of the output buffer， leading to a buffer overflow. A buffer overflow condition exists when a program attempts to put more data in a buffer than it can hold， or when a program attempts to put data in a memory area outside of the boundaries of a buffer. The simplest type of error， and the most common cause of buffer overflows， is the 'classic' case in which the program copies the buffer without restricting how much is copied. Other variants exist， but the existence of a classic overflow strongly suggests that the programmer is not considering even the most basic of security protections.<PlainLiteral>

CVE-2019-12745	out/out.UsrMgr.php in SeedDMS before 5.1.11 allows Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via the name field.
CWE-252	The software does not check the return value from a method or function， which can prevent it from detecting unexpected states and conditions. Two common programmer assumptions are 'this function call can never fail' and 'it doesn't matter if this function call fails'. If an attacker can force the function to fail or otherwise return a value that is not expected， then the subsequent program logic could lead to a vulnerability， because the software is not in a state that the programmer assumes. For example， if the program calls a function to drop privileges but does not check the return code to ensure that privileges were successfully dropped， then the program will continue to operate with the higher privileges.<PlainLiteral>

CVE-2017-8229	Amcrest IPM-721S V2.420.AC00.16.R.20160909 devices allow an unauthenticated attacker to download the administrative credentials. If the firmware version V2.420.AC00.16.R 9/9/2016 is dissected using binwalk tool, one obtains a _user-x.squashfs.img.extracted archive which contains the filesystem set up on the device that many of the binaries in the /usr folder. The binary "sonia" is the one that has the vulnerable function that sets up the default credentials on the device. If one opens this binary in IDA-pro one will notice that this follows a ARM little endian format. The function sub_436D6 in IDA pro is identified to be setting up the configuration for the device. If one scrolls to the address 0x000437C2 then one can see that /current_config is being set as an ALIAS for /mnt/mtd/Config folder on the device. If one TELNETs into the device and navigates to /mnt/mtd/Config folder, one can observe that it contains various files such as Account1, Account2, SHAACcount1, etc. This means that if one navigates to http://[IPofcamera]/current_config/Sha1Account1 then one should be able to view the content of the files. The security researchers assumed that this was only possible only after authentication to the device. However, when unauthenticated access tests were performed for the same URL as provided above, it was observed that the device file could be downloaded without any authentication.

CWECategory-361	This category represents one of the phyla in the Seven Pernicious Kingdoms vulnerability classification. It includes weaknesses related to the improper management of time and state in an environment that supports simultaneous or near-simultaneous computation by multiple systems， processes， or threads. According to the authors of the Seven Pernicious Kingdoms， 'Distributed computation is about time and state. That is， in order for more than one component to communicate， state must be shared， and all that takes time. Most programmers anthropomorphize their work. They think about one thread of control carrying out the entire program in the same way they would if they had to do the job themselves. Modern computers， however， switch between tasks very quickly， and in multi-core， multi-CPU， or distributed systems， two events may take place at exactly the same time. Defects rush to fill the gap between the programmer's model of how a program executes and what happens in reality. These defects are related to unexpected interactions between threads， processes， time， and information. These interactions happen through shared state: semaphores， variables， the file system， and， basically， anything that can store information.'<PlainLiteral>

CVE-2017-8331	An issue was discovered on Securifi Almond, Almond+, and Almond 2015 devices with firmware AL-R096. The device provides a user with the capability of adding new port forwarding rules to the device. It seems that the POST parameters passed in this request to set up routes on the device can be set in such a way that would result in passing commands to a "system" API in the function and thus result in command injection on the device. If the firmware version AL-R096 is dissected using binwalk tool, we obtain a cpio-root archive which contains the filesystem set up on the device that contains all the binaries. The binary "goahead" is the one that has the vulnerable function that recieves the values sent by the POST request. If we open this binary in IDA-pro we will notice that this follows a MIPS little endian format. The function sub_43C280in IDA pro is identified to be receiving the values sent in the POST request and the value set in POST parameter "ip_address" is extracted at address 0x0043C2F0. The POST parameter "ipaddress" is concatenated at address 0x0043C958 and this is passed to a "system" function at address 0x00437284. This allows an attacker to provide the payload of his/her choice and finally take control of the device.

CVE-2017-8230	On Amcrest IPM-721S V2.420.AC00.16.R.20160909 devices, the users on the device are divided into 2 groups "admin" and "user". However, as a part of security analysis it was identified that a low privileged user who belongs to the "user" group and who has access to login in to the web administrative interface of the device can add a new administrative user to the interface using HTTP APIs provided by the device and perform all the actions as an administrative user by using that account. If the firmware version V2.420.AC00.16.R 9/9/2016 is dissected using binwalk tool, one obtains a _user-x.squashfs.img.extracted archive which contains the filesystem set up on the device that many of the binaries in the /usr folder. The binary "sonia" is the one that has the vulnerable functions that performs the various action described in HTTP APIs. If one opens this binary in IDA-pro one will notice that this follows a ARM little endian format. The function at address 0x00429084 in IDA pro is the one that processes the HTTP API request for "addUser" action. If one traces the calls to this function, it can be clearly seen that the function sub_ 41F38C at address 0x0041F588 parses the call received from the browser and passes it to the "addUser" function without any authorization check.

CVE-2001-0609	Format string vulnerability in Infodrom cfingerd 1.4.3 and earlier allows a remote attacker to gain additional privileges via a malformed ident reply that is passed to the syslog function.
CAPEC-111	An attacker targets a system that uses JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) as a transport mechanism between the client and the server (common in Web 2.0 systems using AJAX) to steal possibly confidential information transmitted from the server back to the client inside the JSON object by taking advantage of the loophole in the browser's Same Origin Policy that does not prohibit JavaScript from one website to be included and executed in the context of another website. An attacker gets the victim to visit his or her malicious page that contains a script tag whose source points to the vulnerable system with a URL that requests a response from the server containing a JSON object with possibly confidential information. The malicious page also contains malicious code to capture the JSON object returned by the server before any other processing on it can take place， typically by overriding the JavaScript function used to create new objects. This hook allows the malicious code to get access to the creation of each object and transmit the possibly sensitive contents of the captured JSON object to the attackers' server. There is nothing in the browser's security model to prevent the attackers' malicious JavaScript code (originating from attacker's domain) to set up an environment (as described above) to intercept a JSON object response (coming from the vulnerable target system's domain)， read its contents and transmit to the attackers' controlled site. The same origin policy protects the domain object model (DOM)， but not the JSON.<PlainLiteral>

For example, NFS file systems could be mounted through the portmapper despite export restrictions.
CAPEC-203	An adversary exploits a weakness in authorization in order to modify content within a registry (e.g.， Windows Registry， Mac plist， application registry). Editing registry information can permit the adversary to hide configuration information or remove indicators of compromise to cover up activity. Many applications utilize registries to store configuration and service information. As such， modification of registry information can affect individual services (affecting billing， authorization， or even allowing for identity spoofing) or the overall configuration of a targeted application. For example， both Java RMI and SOAP use registries to track available services. Changing registry values is sometimes a preliminary step towards completing another attack pattern， but given the long term usage of many registry values， manipulation of registry information could be its own end.<PlainLiteral>

CAPEC-118	Attack patterns within this category focus on the gathering， collection， and theft of information by an adversary. The adversary may collect this information through a variety of methods including active querying as well as passive observation. By exploiting weaknesses in the design or configuration of the target and its communications， an adversary is able to get the target to reveal more information than intended. Information retrieved may aid the adversary in making inferences about potential weaknesses， vulnerabilities， or techniques that assist the adversary's objectives. This information may include details regarding the configuration or capabilities of the target， clues as to the timing or nature of activities， or otherwise sensitive information. Often this sort of attack is undertaken in preparation for some other type of attack， although the collection of information by itself may in some cases be the end goal of the adversary.<PlainLiteral>

CAPEC-237	The attacker may submit a malicious signed code from another language to obtain access to privileges that were not intentionally exposed by the sandbox， thus escaping the sandbox. For instance， Java code cannot perform unsafe operations， such as modifying arbitrary memory locations， due to restrictions placed on it by the Byte code Verifier and the JVM. If allowed， Java code can call directly into native C code， which may perform unsafe operations， such as call system calls and modify arbitrary memory locations on their behalf. To provide isolation， Java does not grant untrusted code with unmediated access to native C code. Instead， the sandboxed code is typically allowed to call some subset of the pre-existing native code that is part of standard libraries.<PlainLiteral>

This vulnerability allows users to embed arbitrary JavaScript code in the Web UI thus altering the intended functionality potentially leading to credentials disclosure within a trusted session.

CVE-2011-0056	Buffer overflow in the JavaScript engine in Mozilla Firefox before 3.5.17 and 3.6.x before 3.6.14, and SeaMonkey before 2.0.12, might allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via vectors involving exception timing and a large number of string values, aka an "atom map" issue.
CAPEC-202	An adversary creates a client application to interface with a target service where the client violates assumptions the service makes about clients. Services that have designated client applications (as opposed to services that use general client applications， such as IMAP or POP mail servers which can interact with any IMAP or POP client) may assume that the client will follow specific procedures. For example， servers may assume that clients will accurately compute values (such as prices)， will send correctly structured messages， and will attempt to ensure efficient interactions with the server. By reverse-engineering a client and creating their own version， an adversary can take advantage of these assumptions to abuse service functionality. For example， a purchasing service might send a unit price to its client and expect the client to correctly compute the total cost of a purchase. If the adversary uses a malicious client， however， the adversary could ignore the server input and declare any total price. Likewise， an adversary could configure the client to retain network or other server resources for longer than legitimately necessary in order to degrade server performance. Even services with general clients can be susceptible to this attack if they assume certain client behaviors. However， such services generally can make fewer assumptions about the behavior of their clients in the first place and， as such， are less likely to make assumptions that an adversary can exploit.<PlainLiteral>

CVE-2017-10722	Recently it was discovered as a part of the research on IoT devices in the most recent firmware for Shekar Endoscope that the desktop application used to connect to the device suffers from a stack overflow if more than 26 characters are passed to it as the Wi-Fi password. This application is installed on the device and an attacker who can provide the right payload can execute code on the user's system directly. Any breach of this system can allow an attacker to get access to all the data that the user has access too. The application uses a dynamic link library(DLL) called "avilib.dll" which is used by the application to send binary packets to the device that allow to control the device. One such action that the DLL provides is change password in the function "sendchangepass" which allows a user to change the Wi-Fi password on the device. This function calls a sub function "sub_75876EA0" at address 0x7587857C. The function determines which action to execute based on the parameters sent to it. The "sendchangepass" passes the datastring as the second argument which is the password we enter in the textbox and integer 2 as first argument. The rest of the 3 arguments are set to 0. The function "sub_75876EA0" at address 0x75876F19 uses the first argument received and to determine which block to jump to. Since the argument passed is 2, it jumps to 0x7587718C and proceeds from there to address 0x758771C2 which calculates the length of the data string passed as the first parameter.This length and the first argument are then passed to the address 0x7587726F which calls a memmove function which uses a stack address as the destination where the password typed by us is passed as the source and length calculated above is passed as the number of bytes to copy which leads to a stack overflow.

CAPEC-297	An adversary sends a TCP segment with the ACK flag set to a remote host for the purpose of determining if the host is alive. This is one of several TCP 'ping' types. The RFC 793 expected behavior for a service is to respond with a RST 'reset' packet to any unsolicited ACK segment that is not part of an existing connection. So by sending an ACK segment to a port， the adversary can identify that the host is alive by looking for a RST packet. Typically， a remote server will respond with a RST regardless of whether a port is open or closed. In this way， TCP ACK pings cannot discover the state of a remote port because the behavior is the same in either case. The firewall will look up the ACK packet in its state-table and discard the segment because it does not correspond to any active connection. A TCP ACK Ping can be used to discover if a host is alive via RST response packets sent from the host.<PlainLiteral>

CAPEC-63	An adversary embeds malicious scripts in content that will be served to web browsers. The goal of the attack is for the target software， the client-side browser， to execute the script with the users' privilege level. An attack of this type exploits a programs' vulnerabilities that are brought on by allowing remote hosts to execute code and scripts. Web browsers， for example， have some simple security controls in place， but if a remote attacker is allowed to execute scripts (through injecting them in to user-generated content like bulletin boards) then these controls may be bypassed. Further， these attacks are very difficult for an end user to detect.<PlainLiteral>

CAPEC-465	A transparent proxy serves as an intermediate between the client and the internet at large. It intercepts all requests originating from the client and forwards them to the correct location. The proxy also intercepts all responses to the client and forwards these to the client. All of this is done in a manner transparent to the client. Transparent proxies are often used by enterprises and ISPs. For requests originating at the client transparent proxies need to figure out the final destination of the client's data packet. Two ways are available to do that: either by looking at the layer three (network) IP address or by examining layer seven (application) HTTP header destination. A browser has same origin policy that typically prevents scripts coming from one domain initiating requests to other websites from which they did not come. To circumvent that， however， malicious Flash or an Applet that is executing in the user's browser can attempt to create a cross-domain socket connection from the client to the remote domain. The transparent proxy will examine the HTTP header of the request and direct it to the remote site thereby partially bypassing the browser's same origin policy. This can happen if the transparent proxy uses the HTTP host header information for addressing rather than the IP address information at the network layer. This attack allows malicious scripts inside the victim's browser to issue cross-domain requests to any hosts accessible to the transparent proxy.<PlainLiteral>

CVE-2017-8335	An issue was discovered on Securifi Almond, Almond+, and Almond 2015 devices with firmware AL-R096. The device provides a user with the capability of setting name for wireless network. These values are stored by the device in NVRAM (Non-volatile RAM). It seems that the POST parameters passed in this request to set up names on the device do not have a string length check on them. This allows an attacker to send a large payload in the "mssid_1" POST parameter. The device also allows a user to view the name of the Wifi Network set by the user. While processing this request, the device calls a function named "getCfgToHTML" at address 0x004268A8 which retrieves the value set earlier by "mssid_1" parameter as SSID2 and this value then results in overflowing the stack set up for this function and allows an attacker to control $ra register value on the stack which allows an attacker to control the device by executing a payload of an attacker's choice. If the firmware version AL-R096 is dissected using binwalk tool, we obtain a cpio-root archive which contains the filesystem set up on the device that contains all the binaries. The binary "goahead" is the one that has the vulnerable function that recieves the values sent by the POST request. If we open this binary in IDA-pro we will notice that this follows a MIPS little endian format. The function sub_00420F38 in IDA pro is identified to be receiving the values sent in the POST parameter "mssid_1" at address 0x0042BA00 and then sets in the NVRAM at address 0x0042C314. The value is later retrieved in the function "getCfgToHTML" at address 0x00426924 and this results in overflowing the buffer due to "strcat" function that is utilized by this function.

CAPEC-29	This attack targets a race condition occurring between the time of check (state) for a resource and the time of use of a resource. A typical example is file access. The adversary can leverage a file access race condition by 'running the race'， meaning that they would modify the resource between the first time the target program accesses the file and the time the target program uses the file. During that period of time， the adversary could replace or modify the file， causing the application to behave unexpectedly.<PlainLiteral>

The binary "cgibox" is the one that has the vulnerable function "sub_7EAFC" that receives the values sent by the GET request. If we open this binary in IDA-pro we will notice that this follows a ARM little endian format.

CVE-2017-8330	An issue was discovered on Securifi Almond, Almond+, and Almond 2015 devices with firmware AL-R096. The device provides a UPnP functionality for devices to interface with the router and interact with the device. It seems that the "NewInMessage" SOAP parameter passed with a huge payload results in crashing the process. If the firmware version AL-R096 is dissected using binwalk tool, we obtain a cpio-root archive which contains the filesystem set up on the device that contains all the binaries. The binary "miniupnpd" is the one that has the vulnerable function that receives the values sent by the SOAP request. If we open this binary in IDA-pro we will notice that this follows a MIPS little endian format. The function WscDevPutMessage at address 0x0041DBB8 in IDA pro is identified to be receiving the values sent in the SOAP request. The SOAP parameter "NewInMesage" received at address 0x0041DC30 causes the miniupnpd process to finally crash when a second request is sent to the same process.

CVE-2012-5817	Codehaus XFire 1.2.6 and earlier, as used in the Amazon EC2 API Tools Java library and other products, does not verify that the server hostname matches a domain name in the subject's Common Name (CN) or subjectAltName field of the X.509 certificate, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof SSL servers via an arbitrary valid certificate.
CAPEC-190	An attacker analyzes a binary file or executable for the purpose of discovering the structure， function， and possibly source-code of the file by using a variety of analysis techniques to effectively determine how the software functions and operates. This type of analysis is also referred to as Reverse Code Engineering， as techniques exist for extracting source code from an executable. Several techniques are often employed for this purpose， both black box and white box. The use of computer bus analyzers and packet sniffers allows the binary to be studied at a level of interactions with its computing environment， such as a host OS， inter-process communication， and/or network communication. This type of analysis falls into the 'black box' category because it involves behavioral analysis of the software without reference to source code， object code， or protocol specifications.<PlainLiteral>
CVE-2011-4117	The Batch::BatchRun module 1.03 for Perl does not properly handle temporary files.
CVE-2018-0443	A vulnerability in the Control and Provisioning of Wireless Access Points (CAPWAP) protocol component of Cisco Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to improper input validation on fields within CAPWAP Discovery Request packets by the affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious CAPWAP Discovery Request packets to the Cisco WLC Software. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the Cisco WLC Software to disconnect associated access points (APs). While the APs disconnect and reconnect, service will be unavailable for a brief period of time, resulting in a DoS condition.

CVE-2019-13175	Read the Docs before 3.5.1 has an Open Redirect if certain user-defined redirects are used. This affects private instances of Read the Docs (in addition to the public readthedocs.org web sites).
CAPEC-145	An adversary spoofs a checksum message for the purpose of making a payload appear to have a valid corresponding checksum. Checksums are used to verify message integrity. They consist of some value based on the value of the message they are protecting. Hash codes are a common checksum mechanism. Both the sender and recipient are able to compute the checksum based on the contents of the message. If the message contents change between the sender and recipient， the sender and recipient will compute different checksum values. Since the sender's checksum value is transmitted with the message， the recipient would know that a modification occurred. In checksum spoofing an adversary modifies the message body and then modifies the corresponding checksum so that the recipient's checksum calculation will match the checksum (created by the adversary) in the message. This would prevent the recipient from realizing that a change occurred.<PlainLiteral>
CWE-912	The software contains functionality that is not documented， not part of the specification， and not accessible through an interface or command sequence that is obvious to the software's users or administrators. Hidden functionality can take many forms， such as intentionally malicious code， 'Easter Eggs' that contain extraneous functionality such as games， developer-friendly shortcuts that reduce maintenance or support costs such as hard-coded accounts， etc. From a security perspective， even when the functionality is not intentionally malicious or damaging， it can increase the software's attack surface and expose additional weaknesses beyond what is already exposed by the intended functionality. Even if it is not easily accessible， the hidden functionality could be useful for attacks that modify the control flow of the application.<PlainLiteral>

CAPEC-472	An attacker carefully crafts small snippets of Java Script to efficiently detect the type of browser the potential victim is using. Many web-based attacks need prior knowledge of the web browser including the version of browser to ensure successful exploitation of a vulnerability. Having this knowledge allows an attacker to target the victim with attacks that specifically exploit known or zero day weaknesses in the type and version of the browser used by the victim. Automating this process via Java Script as a part of the same delivery system used to exploit the browser is considered more efficient as the attacker can supply a browser fingerprinting method and integrate it with exploit code， all contained in Java Script and in response to the same web page request by the browser.<PlainLiteral>

By adding a URL path parameter with special encodings, an attacker may be able to bypass a security constraint. The root cause of this issue is a lack of clarity regarding the handling of path parameters in the Servlet Specification. Some Servlet containers include path parameters in the value returned for getPathInfo() and some do not. Spring Security uses the value returned by getPathInfo() as part of the process of mapping requests to security constraints. In this particular attack, different character encodings used in path parameters allows secured Spring MVC static resource URLs to be bypassed.

CVE-2017-9392	An issue was discovered on Vera VeraEdge 1.7.19 and Veralite 1.7.481 devices. The device provides UPnP services that are available on port 3480 and can also be accessed via port 80 using the url "/port_3480". It seems that the UPnP services provide "request_image" as one of the service actions for a normal user to retrieve an image from a camera that is controlled by the controller. It seems that the "res" (resolution) parameter passed in the query string is not sanitized and is stored on the stack which allows an attacker to overflow the buffer. The function "LU::Generic_IP_Camera_Manager::REQ_Image" is activated when the lu_request_image is passed as the "id" parameter in the query string. This function then calls "LU::Generic_IP_Camera_Manager::GetUrlFromArguments". This function retrieves all the parameters passed in the query string including "res" and then uses the value passed in it to fill up buffer using the sprintf function. However, the function in this case lacks a simple length check and as a result an attacker who is able to send more than 184 characters can easily overflow the values stored on the stack including the $RA value and thus execute code on the device.
CVE-2019-10987	In WebAccess/SCADA Versions 8.3.5 and prior, multiple out-of-bounds write vulnerabilities are caused by a lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data. Exploitation of these vulnerabilities may allow remote code execution.

CVE-2017-9388	An issue was discovered on Vera VeraEdge 1.7.19 and Veralite 1.7.481 devices. The device provides a web user interface that allows a user to manage the device. As a part of the functionality the device firmware file contains a file known as proxy.sh which allows the device to proxy a specific request to and from from another website. This is primarily used as a method of communication between the device and Vera website when the user is logged in to the https://home.getvera.com and allows the device to communicate between the device and website. One of the parameters retrieved by this specific script is "url". This parameter is not sanitized by the script correctly and is passed in a call to "eval" to execute "curl" functionality. This allows an attacker to escape from the executed command and then execute any commands of his/her choice.

CVE-2018-0441	A vulnerability in the 802.11r Fast Transition feature set of Cisco IOS Access Points (APs) Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to a corruption of certain timer mechanisms triggered by specific roaming events. This corruption will eventually cause a timer crash. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious reassociation events multiple times to the same AP in a short period of time, causing a DoS condition on the affected AP.
CWE-512	None
CVE-2017-7189	main/streams/xp_socket.c in PHP 7.x before 2017-03-07 misparses fsockopen calls, such as by interpreting fsockopen('127.0.0.1:80', 443) as if the address/port were 127.0.0.1:80:443, which is later truncated to 127.0.0.1:80. This behavior has a security risk if the explicitly provided port number (i.e., 443 in this example) is hardcoded into an application as a security policy, but the hostname argument (i.e., 127.0.0.1:80 in this example) is obtained from untrusted input.
CVE-2010-1866	The dechunk filter in PHP 5.3 through 5.3.2, when decoding an HTTP chunked encoding stream, allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly trigger memory corruption via a negative chunk size, which bypasses a signed comparison, related to an integer overflow in the chunk size decoder.
CWECategory-227	This category represents one of the phyla in the Seven Pernicious Kingdoms vulnerability classification. It includes weaknesses that involve the software useing an API in a manner contrary to its intended use. According to the authors of the Seven Pernicious Kingdoms， 'An API is a contract between a caller and a callee. The most common forms of API misuse occurs when the caller does not honor its end of this contract. For example， if a program does not call chdir() after calling chroot()， it violates the contract that specifies how to change the active root directory in a secure fashion. Another good example of library abuse is expecting the callee to return trustworthy DNS information to the caller. In this case， the caller misuses the callee API by making certain assumptions about its behavior (that the return value can be used for authentication purposes). One can also violate the caller-callee contract from the other side. For example， if a coder subclasses SecureRandom and returns a non-random value， the contract is violated.'<PlainLiteral>

CAPEC-215	An attacker sends random， malformed， or otherwise unexpected messages to a target application and observes the application's log or error messages returned. Fuzzing techniques involve sending random or malformed messages to a target and monitoring the target's response. The attacker does not initially know how a target will respond to individual messages but by attempting a large number of message variants they may find a variant that trigger's desired behavior. In this attack， the purpose of the fuzzing is to observe the application's log and error messages， although fuzzing a target can also sometimes cause the target to enter an unstable state， causing a crash. By observing logs and error messages， the attacker can learn details about the configuration of the target application and might be able to cause the target to disclose sensitive information.<PlainLiteral>

This attack differs from other forms of API abuse in that the attacker is blindly attempting to invoke options in the hope that one of them will work rather than specifically targeting a known option. Nonetheless， even if the attacker is familiar with the published options of a targeted application this attack method may still be fruitful as it might discover unpublicized functionality.<PlainLiteral>

CAPEC-293	An adversary uses a traceroute utility to map out the route which data flows through the network in route to a target destination. Tracerouting can allow the adversary to construct a working topology of systems and routers by listing the systems through which data passes through on their way to the targeted machine. This attack can return varied results depending upon the type of traceroute that is performed. Traceroute works by sending packets to a target while incrementing the Time-to-Live field in the packet header. As the packet traverses each hop along its way to the destination， its TTL expires generating an ICMP diagnostic message that identifies where the packet expired. Traditional techniques for tracerouting involved the use of ICMP and UDP， but as more firewalls began to filter ingress ICMP， methods of traceroute using TCP were developed.<PlainLiteral>

CAPEC-139	An attacker exploits a weakness in input validation on the target by supplying a specially constructed path utilizing dot and slash characters for the purpose of obtaining access to arbitrary files or resources. An attacker modifies a known path on the target in order to reach material that is not available through intended channels. These attacks normally involve adding additional path separators (/ or \\) and/or dots (.)， or encodings thereof， in various combinations in order to reach parent directories or entirely separate trees of the target's directory structure. adversary passively sniffs network communications and captures application code bound for an authorized client. Once obtained， they can use it as-is， or through reverse-engineering glean sensitive information or exploit the trust relationship between the client and server.

CVE-2019-13949	SyGuestBook A5 Version 1.2 has no CSRF protection mechanism, as demonstrated by CSRF for an index.php?c=Administrator&a=update admin password change.
CAPEC-392	An attacker uses a bump key to force a lock on a building or facility and gain entry. Lock Bumping is the use of a special type of key that can be tapped or bumped to cause the pins within the lock to fall into temporary alignment， allowing the lock to be opened. Lock bumping allows an attacker to open a lock without having the correct key. A standard lock is secured by a set of internal pins that prevent the device from turning. Spring loaded driver pins push down on the key pins. When the correct key is inserted， the ridges on the key push the key pins up and against the driver pins， causing correct alignment which allows the lock cylinder to rotate. A bump key is a specially constructed key that exploits this design. When the bump key is struck or firmly tapped， its teeth transfer the force of the tap into the key pins， causing the lock to momentarily shift into proper alignment for the mechanism to be opened.<PlainLiteral>
CVE-2005-4155	registration.PHP in ATutor 1.5.1 pl2 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via an e-mail address that ends in a NULL character, which bypasses the PHP regular expression check.

This will log the attacker in as an administrator where the telnet / ssh services can be enabled, and the credentials for local users can be reset. Also, login.cgi accepts the username as a GET parameter, so login can be achieved by browsing to the /cgi-bin/login.cgi?username=-%20a URI.

CVE-2017-8413	An issue was discovered on D-Link DCS-1100 and DCS-1130 devices. The device runs a custom daemon on UDP port 5978 which is called 'dldps2121' and listens for broadcast packets sent on 255.255.255.255. This daemon handles custom D-Link UDP based protocol that allows D-Link mobile applications and desktop applications to discover D-Link devices on the local network. The binary processes the received UDP packets sent from any device in 'main' function. One path in the function traverses towards a block of code that handles commands to be executed on the device. The custom protocol created by D-Link follows the following pattern: Packetlen， Type of packet; M=MAC address of device or broadcast; D=Device Type;C=base64 encoded command string;test=1111. If a packet is received with the packet type being 'S' or 0x53 then the string passed in the 'C' parameter is base64 decoded and then executed by passing into a System API. We can see at address 0x00009B44 that the string received in packet type subtracts 0x31 or '1' from the packet type and is compared against 0x22 or 'double quotes'. If that is the case， then the packet is sent towards the block of code that executes a command. Then the value stored in 'C' parameter is extracted at address 0x0000A1B0. Finally， the string received is base 64 decoded and passed on to the system API at address 0x0000A2A8 as shown below. The same form of communication can be initiated by any process including an attacker process on the mobile phone or the desktop and this allows a third-party application on the device to execute commands on the device without any authentication by sending just 1 UDP packet with custom base64 encoding.<PlainLiteral>
CAPEC-569	An attacker leverages a tool， device， or program to obtain specific information as provided by a user of the target system. This information is often needed by the attacker to launch a follow-on attack. This attack is different than Social Engineering as the adversary is not tricking or deceiving the user. Instead the adversary is putting a mechanism in place that captures the information that a user legitimately enters into a system. Deploying a keylogger， performing a UAC prompt， or wrapping the Windows default credential provider are all examples of such interactions.<PlainLiteral>

#1217:6	无作为或操作失误
CAPEC-331	An adversary sends a UDP packet to a closed port on the target machine to solicit an IP Header's total length field value within the echoed 'Port Unreachable' error message. RFC1122 specifies that the Header of the request must be echoed back when an error is sent in response， but some operating systems and firmware alter the integrity of the original header. Non-standard ICMP/IP implementations result in response that are useful for individuating remote operating system or router firmware versions. There are four general response types that can be used to distinguish operating systems apart: 1) the IP total length field may be calculated correctly， 2) an operating system may add 20 or more additional bytes to the length calculation， 3) the operating system may subtract 20 or more bytes from the correct length of the field or 4) the IP total length field is calculated with any other incorrect value. This type of behavior is useful for building a signature-base of operating system responses， particularly when error messages contain other types of information that is useful identifying specific operating system responses.<PlainLiteral>

#1179:9	组织或信息系统安全风险需要通过具体的计算方法实现风险值的计算。风险计算方法一般分为定性计算方法和定量计算方法两大类:a)定性计算方法是将风险的各要素资产、威胁、脆弱性等的相关属性进行量化(或等级化)赋值，然后选用具体的计算方法(如相乘法或矩阵法)进行风险计算;b)定量计算方法是通过将资产价值和凤险等量化为财务价值的方式来进行计算的一=种方祛。由于定量计算法需要等量化财务价值，在实际操作中往往难以实现。由于定量计算方法在实际工作中可操作性较差，一般风险计算多采用定性计算方祛。风险的定性计算方法实质反应的是组织或信息系统面临风险大小的准确排序，确定风险的性质(无关紧要可接受、待观察，不可接受等)，而不是风险计算值本身的准确性。具体风险计算方法，可参考GB/T 20984一 2007中的附录A (资料性附录)凤险的计算方法。

CWE-646	The software allows a file to be uploaded， but it relies on the file name or extension of the file to determine the appropriate behaviors. This could be used by attackers to cause the file to be misclassified and processed in a dangerous fashion. An application might use the file name or extension of of a user-supplied file to determine the proper course of action， such as selecting the correct process to which control should be passed， deciding what data should be made available， or what resources should be allocated. If the attacker can cause the code to misclassify the supplied file， then the wrong action could occur. For example， an attacker could supply a file that ends in a '.php.gif' extension that appears to be a GIF image， but would be processed as PHP code. In extreme cases， code execution is possible， but the attacker could also cause exhaustion of resources， denial of service， exposure of debug or system data (including application source code)， or being bound to a particular server side process. This weakness may be due to a vulnerability in any of the technologies used by the web and application servers， due to misconfiguration， or resultant from another flaw in the application itself.<PlainLiteral>

The device provides UPnP services that are available on port 3480 and can also be accessed via port 80 using the url "/port_3480". It seems that the UPnP services provide "file" as one of the service actions for a normal user to read a file that is stored under the /etc/cmh-lu folder. It retrieves the value from the "parameters" query string variable and then passes it to an internal function "FileUtils::ReadFileIntoBuffer" which is a library function that does not perform any sanitization on the value submitted and this allows an attacker to use directory traversal characters "../" and read files from other folders within the device.

CVE-2019-3875	A vulnerability was found in keycloak before 6.0.2. The X.509 authenticator supports the verification of client certificates through the CRL, where the CRL list can be obtained from the URL provided in the certificate itself (CDP) or through the separately configured path. The CRL are often available over the network through unsecured protocols ('http' or 'ldap') and hence the caller should verify the signature and possibly the certification path. Keycloak currently doesn't validate signatures on CRL, which can result in a possibility of various attacks like man-in-the-middle.
CVE-2018-1304	The URL pattern of "" (the empty string) which exactly maps to the context root was not correctly handled in Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.4, 8.5.0 to 8.5.27, 8.0.0.RC1 to 8.0.49 and 7.0.0 to 7.0.84 when used as part of a security constraint definition. This caused the constraint to be ignored. It was, therefore, possible for unauthorised users to gain access to web application resources that should have been protected. Only security constraints with a URL pattern of the empty string were affected.

CVE-2017-8329	An issue was discovered on Securifi Almond, Almond+, and Almond 2015 devices with firmware AL-R096. The device provides a user with the capability of setting a name for the wireless network. These values are stored by the device in NVRAM (Non-volatile RAM). It seems that the POST parameters passed in this request to set up names on the device do not have a string length check on them. This allows an attacker to send a large payload in the "mssid_1" POST parameter. The device also allows a user to view the name of the Wifi Network set by the user. While processing this request, the device calls a function at address 0x00412CE4 (routerSummary) in the binary "webServer" located in Almond folder, which retrieves the value set earlier by "mssid_1" parameter as SSID2 and this value then results in overflowing the stack set up for this function and allows an attacker to control $ra register value on the stack which allows an attacker to control the device by executing a payload of an attacker's choice. If the firmware version AL-R096 is dissected using binwalk tool, we obtain a cpio-root archive which contains the filesystem set up on the device that contains all the binaries. The binary "goahead" is the one that has the vulnerable function that receives the values sent by the POST request. If we open this binary in IDA-pro we will notice that this follows a MIPS little endian format. The function sub_00420F38 in IDA pro is identified to be receiving the values sent in the POST parameter "mssid_1" at address 0x0042BA00 and then sets in the NVRAM at address 0x0042C314. The value is later retrieved in the function at address 0x00412EAC and this results in overflowing the buffer as the function copies the value directly on the stack.

CVE-2017-8412	An issue was discovered on D-Link DCS-1100 and DCS-1130 devices. The device has a custom binary called mp4ts under the /var/www/video folder. It seems that this binary dumps the HTTP VERB in the system logs. As a part of doing that it retrieves the HTTP VERB sent by the user and uses a vulnerable sprintf function at address 0x0000C3D4 in the function sub_C210 to copy the value into a string and then into a log file. Since there is no bounds check being performed on the environment variable at address 0x0000C360 this results in a stack overflow and overwrites the PC register allowing an attacker to execute buffer overflow or even a command injection attack.

CVE-2017-8417	An issue was discovered on D-Link DCS-1100 and DCS-1130 devices. The device requires that a user logging into the device provide a username and password. However, the device allows D-Link apps on the mobile devices and desktop to communicate with the device without any authentication. As a part of that communication, the device uses custom version of base64 encoding to pass data back and forth between the apps and the device. However, the same form of communication can be initiated by any process including an attacker process on the mobile phone or the desktop and this allows a third party to retrieve the device's password without any authentication by sending just 1 UDP packet with custom base64 encoding. The severity of this attack is enlarged by the fact that there more than 100,000 D-Link devices out there.

CAPEC-292	An adversary sends a probe to an IP address to determine if the host is alive. Host discovery is one of the earliest phases of network reconnaissance. The adversary usually starts with a range of IP addresses belonging to a target network and uses various methods to determine if a host is present at that IP address. Host discovery is usually referred to as 'Ping' scanning using a sonar analogy. The goal is to send a packet through to the IP address and solicit a response from the host. As such， a 'ping' can be virtually any crafted packet whatsoever， provided the adversary can identify a functional host based on its response. An attack of this nature is usually carried out with a 'ping sweep，' where a particular kind of ping is sent to a range of IP addresses.<PlainLiteral>

CVE-2017-9792	In Apache Impala (incubating) before 2.10.0, a malicious user with "ALTER" permissions on an Impala table can access any other Kudu table data by altering the table properties to make it "external" and then changing the underlying table mapping to point to other Kudu tables. This violates and works around the authorization requirement that creating a Kudu external table via Impala requires an "ALL" privilege at the server scope. This privilege requirement for "CREATE" commands is enforced to precisely avoid this scenario where a malicious user can change the underlying Kudu table mapping. The fix is to enforce the same privilege requirement for "ALTER" commands that would make existing non-external Kudu tables external.

CVE-2019-10639	The Linux kernel 4.x (starting from 4.1) and 5.x before 5.0.8 allows Information Exposure (partial kernel address disclosure), leading to a KASLR bypass. Specifically, it is possible to extract the KASLR kernel image offset using the IP ID values the kernel produces for connection-less protocols (e.g., UDP and ICMP). When such traffic is sent to multiple destination IP addresses, it is possible to obtain hash collisions (of indices to the counter array) and thereby obtain the hashing key (via enumeration). This key contains enough bits from a kernel address (of a static variable) so when the key is extracted (via enumeration), the offset of the kernel image is exposed. This attack can be carried out remotely, by the attacker forcing the target device to send UDP or ICMP (or certain other) traffic to attacker-controlled IP addresses. Forcing a server to send UDP traffic is trivial if the server is a DNS server. ICMP traffic is trivial if the server answers ICMP Echo requests (ping). For client targets, if the target visits the attacker's web page, then WebRTC or gQUIC can be used to force UDP traffic to attacker-controlled IP addresses. NOTE: this attack against KASLR became viable in 4.1 because IP ID generation was changed to have a dependency on an address associated with a network namespace.

CVE-2019-1909	A vulnerability in the implementation of Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) functionality in Cisco IOS XR Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected system. The vulnerability is due to incorrect processing of certain BGP update messages. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending BGP update messages that include a specific set of attributes to be processed by an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the BGP process to restart unexpectedly, resulting in a DoS condition. The Cisco implementation of BGP accepts incoming BGP traffic from explicitly defined peers only. To exploit this vulnerability, the malicious BGP update message would need to come from a configured, valid BGP peer or would need to be injected by the attacker into the victim's BGP network on an existing, valid TCP connection to a BGP peer.

CAPEC-294	An adversary sends an ICMP Type 17 Address Mask Request to gather information about a target's networking configuration. ICMP Address Mask Requests are defined by RFC-950， 'Internet Standard Subnetting Procedure.' An Address Mask Request is an ICMP type 17 message that triggers a remote system to respond with a list of its related subnets， as well as its default gateway and broadcast address via an ICMP type 18 Address Mask Reply datagram. Gathering this type of information helps the adversary plan router-based attacks as well as denial-of-service attacks against the broadcast address. Many modern operating systems will not respond to ICMP type 17 messages for security reasons. Determining whether a system or router will respond to an ICMP Address Mask Request helps the adversary determine operating system or firmware version. Additionally， because these types of messages are rare， they are easily spotted by intrusion detection systems. Many ICMP scanning tools support IP spoofing to help conceal the origin of the actual request among a storm of similar ICMP messages. It is a common practice for border firewalls and gateways to be configured to block ingress ICMP type 17 and egress ICMP type 18 messages.<PlainLiteral>
CVE-2002-1200	Balabit Syslog-NG 1.4.x before 1.4.15, and 1.5.x before 1.5.20, when using template filenames or output, does not properly track the size of a buffer when constant characters are encountered during macro expansion, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code.
CVE-2017-8411	An issue was discovered on D-Link DCS-1130 devices. The device provides a user with the capability of setting a SMB folder for the video clippings recorded by the device. It seems that the POST parameters passed in this request (to test if email credentials and hostname sent to the device work properly) result in being passed as commands to a "system" API in the function and thus result in command injection on the device. If the firmware version is dissected using binwalk tool, we obtain a cramfs-root archive which contains the filesystem set up on the device that contains all the binaries. The library "libmailutils.so" is the one that has the vulnerable function "sub_1FC4" that receives the values sent by the POST request. If we open this binary in IDA-pro we will notice that this follows an ARM little endian format. The function sub_1FC4 in IDA pro is identified to be receiving the values sent in the POST request and the value set in POST parameter "receiver1" is extracted in function "sub_15AC" which is then passed to the vulnerable system API call. The vulnerable library function is accessed in "cgibox" binary at address 0x00023BCC which calls the "Send_mail" function in "libmailutils.so" binary as shown below which results in the vulnerable POST parameter being passed to the library which results in the command injection issue.

CAPEC-304	An adversary uses a TCP NULL scan to determine if ports are closed on the target machine. This scan type is accomplished by sending TCP segments with no flags in the packet header， generating packets that are illegal based on RFC 793. The RFC 793 expected behavior is that any TCP segment with an out-of-state Flag sent to an open port is discarded， whereas segments with out-of-state flags sent to closed ports should be handled with a RST in response. This behavior should allow an attacker to scan for closed ports by sending certain types of rule-breaking packets (out of sync or disallowed by the TCB) and detect closed ports via RST packets. In addition to being fast， the major advantage of this scan type is its ability to scan through stateless firewall or ACL filters. Such filters are configured to block access to ports usually by preventing SYN packets， thus stopping any attempt to 'build' a connection. NULL packets， like out-of-state FIN or ACK packets， tend to pass through such devices undetected. Many operating systems， however， do not implement RFC 793 exactly and for this reason NULL scans do not work as expected against these devices. Some operating systems， like Microsoft Windows， send a RST packet in response to any out-of-sync (or malformed) TCP segments received by a listening socket (rather than dropping the packet via RFC 793)， thus preventing an attacker from distinguishing between open and closed ports. NULL scans are limited by the range of platforms against which they work. Additionally， because open ports are inferred via no responses being generated， one cannot distinguish an open port from a filtered port without further analysis. For instance， NULL scanning a system protected by a stateful firewall may indicate all ports being open. Because of their obvious rule-breaking nature， NULL scans are flagged by almost all intrusion prevention or intrusion detection systems.<PlainLiteral>

CVE-2017-8228	Amcrest IPM-721S V2.420.AC00.16.R.20160909 devices mishandle reboots within the past two hours. Amcrest cloud services does not perform a thorough verification when allowing the user to add a new camera to the user's account to ensure that the user actually owns the camera other than knowing the serial number of the camera. This can allow an attacker who knows the serial number to easily add another user's camera to an attacker's cloud account and control it completely. This is possible in case of any camera that is currently not a part of an Amcrest cloud account or has been removed from the user's cloud account. Also, another requirement for a successful attack is that the user should have rebooted the camera in the last two hours. However, both of these conditions are very likely for new cameras that are sold over the Internet at many ecommerce websites or vendors that sell the Amcrest products. The successful attack results in an attacker being able to completely control the camera which includes being able to view and listen on what the camera can see, being able to change the motion detection settings and also be able to turn the camera off without the user being aware of it. Note: The same attack can be executed using the Amcrest Cloud mobile application.

CVE-2019-0849	An information disclosure vulnerability exists when the Windows GDI component improperly discloses the contents of its memory, aka 'Windows GDI Information Disclosure Vulnerability'. This CVE ID is unique from CVE-2019-0802.
CAPEC-137	An adversary exploits weaknesses in input validation by manipulating the content of request parameters for the purpose of undermining the security of the target. Some parameter encodings use text characters as separators. For example， parameters in a HTTP GET message are encoded as name-value pairs separated by an ampersand (&). If an attacker can supply text strings that are used to fill in these parameters， then they can inject special characters used in the encoding scheme to add or modify parameters. For example， if user input is fed directly into an HTTP GET request and the user provides the value 'myInput&new_param=myValue'， then the input parameter is set to myInput， but a new parameter (new_param) is also added with a value of myValue. This can significantly change the meaning of the query that is processed by the server. Any encoding scheme where parameters are identified and separated by text characters is potentially vulnerable to this attack - the HTTP GET encoding used above is just one example.<PlainLiteral>

CVE-2019-1599	A vulnerability in the network stack of Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on the affected device. The vulnerability is due to an issue with allocating and freeing memory buffers in the network stack. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted TCP streams to an affected device in a sustained way. A successful exploit could cause the network stack of an affected device to run out of available buffers, impairing operations of control plane and management plane protocols, resulting in a DoS condition. Note: This vulnerability can be triggered only by traffic that is destined to an affected device and cannot be exploited using traffic that transits an affected device.

CVE-2003-1468	The Web_Links module in PHP-Nuke 6.0 through 6.5 final allows remote attackers to obtain the full web server path via an invalid cid parameter that is non-numeric or null, which leaks the pathname in an error message.
CWE-65	The software， when opening a file or directory， does not sufficiently handle when the name is associated with a hard link to a target that is outside of the intended control sphere. This could allow an attacker to cause the software to operate on unauthorized files. Failure for a system to check for hard links can result in vulnerability to different types of attacks. For example， an attacker can escalate their privileges if a file used by a privileged program is replaced with a hard link to a sensitive file (e.g. AUTOEXEC.BAT). When the process opens the file， the attacker can assume the privileges of that process， or prevent the program from accurately processing data.<PlainLiteral>

CAPEC-492	An adversary may execute an attack on a program that uses a poor Regular Expression(Regex) implementation by choosing input that results in an extreme situation for the Regex. A typical extreme situation operates at exponential time compared to the input size. This is due to most implementations using a Nondeterministic Finite Automaton(NFA) state machine to be built by the Regex algorithm since NFA allows backtracking and thus more complex regular expressions. The algorithm builds a finite state machine and based on the input transitions through all the states until the end of the input is reached. NFA engines may evaluate each character in the input string multiple times during the backtracking. The algorithm tries each path through the NFA one by one until a match is found; the malicious input is crafted so every path is tried which results in a failure. Exploitation of the Regex results in programs hanging or taking a very long time to complete. These attacks may target various layers of the Internet due to regular expressions being used in validation.<PlainLiteral>

CVE-2018-0092	A vulnerability in the network-operator user role implementation for Cisco NX-OS System Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to improperly delete valid user accounts. The network-operator role should not be able to delete other configured users on the device. The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper role-based access control (RBAC) checks for the actions that a user with the network-operator role is allowed to perform. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the device with user credentials that give that user the network-operator role. Successful exploitation could allow the attacker to impact the integrity of the device by deleting configured user credentials. The attacker would need valid user credentials for the device. This vulnerability affects the following Cisco products running Cisco NX-OS System Software: Nexus 3000 Series Switches, Nexus 3600 Platform Switches, Nexus 9000 Series Switches in standalone NX-OS mode, Nexus 9500 R-Series Line Cards and Fabric Modules.

CWE-379	The software creates a temporary file in a directory whose permissions allow unintended actors to determine the file's existence or otherwise access that file. On some operating systems， the fact that the temporary file exists may be apparent to any user with sufficient privileges to access that directory. Since the file is visible， the application that is using the temporary file could be known. If one has access to list the processes on the system， the attacker has gained information about what the user is doing at that time. By correlating this with the applications the user is running， an attacker could potentially discover what a user's actions are. From this， higher levels of security could be breached.<PlainLiteral>

CVE-2016-7055	There is a carry propagating bug in the Broadwell-specific Montgomery multiplication procedure in OpenSSL 1.0.2 and 1.1.0 before 1.1.0c that handles input lengths divisible by, but longer than 256 bits. Analysis suggests that attacks against RSA, DSA and DH private keys are impossible. This is because the subroutine in question is not used in operations with the private key itself and an input of the attacker's direct choice. Otherwise the bug can manifest itself as transient authentication and key negotiation failures or reproducible erroneous outcome of public-key operations with specially crafted input. Among EC algorithms only Brainpool P-512 curves are affected and one presumably can attack ECDH key negotiation. Impact was not analyzed in detail, because pre-requisites for attack are considered unlikely. Namely multiple clients have to choose the curve in question and the server has to share the private key among them, neither of which is default behaviour. Even then only clients that chose the curve will be affected.

CVE-2018-1227	Pivotal Concourse after 2018-03-05 might allow remote attackers to have an unspecified impact, if a customer obtained the Concourse software from a DNS domain that is no longer controlled by Pivotal. The original domain for the Concourse CI (concourse-dot-ci) open source project has been registered by an unknown actor, and is therefore no longer the official website for Concourse CI. The new official domain is concourse-ci.org. At approximately 4 am EDT on March 7, 2018 the Concourse OSS team began receiving reports that the Concourse domain was not responding. The Concourse OSS team discovered, upon investigation with both the original and the new domain registrars, that the originating domain registrar had made the domain available for purchase. This was done despite the domain being renewed by the Concourse OSS team through August 2018. For a customer to be affected, they would have needed to access a download from a "concourse-dot-ci" domain web site after March 6, 2018 18:00:00 EST. Accessing that domain is NOT recommended by Pivotal. Anyone who had been using that domain should immediately begin using the concourse-ci.org domain instead. Customers can also safely access Concourse software from the traditionally available locations on the Pivotal Network or GitHub.

CVE-2017-13719	The Amcrest IPM-721S Amcrest_IPC-AWXX_Eng_N_V2.420.AC00.17.R.20170322 allows HTTP requests that permit enabling various functionalities of the camera by using HTTP APIs, instead of the web management interface that is provided by the application. This HTTP API receives the credentials as base64 encoded in the Authorization HTTP header. However, a missing length check in the code allows an attacker to send a string of 1024 characters in the password field, and allows an attacker to exploit a memory corruption issue. This can allow an attacker to circumvent the account protection mechanism and brute force the credentials. If the firmware version Amcrest_IPC-AWXX_Eng_N_V2.420.AC00.17.R.20170322 is dissected using the binwalk tool, one obtains a _user-x.squashfs.img.extracted archive which contains the filesystem set up on the device that has many of the binaries in the /usr folder. The binary "sonia" is the one that has the vulnerable function that performs the credential check in the binary for the HTTP API specification. If we open this binary in IDA Pro we will notice that this follows an ARM little-endian format. The function at address 00415364 in IDA Pro starts the HTTP authentication process. This function calls another function at sub_ 0042CCA0 at address 0041549C. This function performs a strchr operation after base64 decoding the credentials, and stores the result on the stack, which results in a stack-based buffer overflow.

CVE-2017-9384	An issue was discovered on Vera VeraEdge 1.7.19 and Veralite 1.7.481 devices. The device provides a web user interface that allows a user to manage the device. As a part of the functionality the device firmware file contains a file known as relay.sh which allows the device to create relay ports and connect the device to Vera servers. This is primarily used as a method of communication between the device and Vera servers so the devices can be communicated with even when the user is not at home. One of the parameters retrieved by this specific script is "remote_host". This parameter is not sanitized by the script correctly and is passed in a call to "eval" to execute another script where remote_host is concatenated to be passed a parameter to the second script. This allows an attacker to escape from the executed command and then execute any commands of his/her choice.

CWE-197	Truncation errors occur when a primitive is cast to a primitive of a smaller size and data is lost in the conversion. When a primitive is cast to a smaller primitive， the high order bits of the large value are lost in the conversion， potentially resulting in an unexpected value that is not equal to the original value. This value may be required as an index into a buffer， a loop iterator， or simply necessary state data. In any case， the value cannot be trusted and the system will be in an undefined state. While this method may be employed viably to isolate the low bits of a value， this usage is rare， and truncation usually implies that an implementation error has occurred.<PlainLiteral>

CVE-2018-0102	A vulnerability in the Pong tool of Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a reload of an affected device, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability exists because the affected software attempts to free the same area of memory twice. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a pong request to an affected device from a location on the network that causes the pong reply packet to egress both a FabricPath port and a non-FabricPath port. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a dual or quad supervisor virtual port-channel (vPC) to reload. This vulnerability affects the following products when running Cisco NX-OS Software Release 7.2(1)D(1), 7.2(2)D1(1), or 7.2(2)D1(2) with both the Pong and FabricPath features enabled and the FabricPath port is actively monitored via a SPAN session: Cisco Nexus 7000 Series Switches and Cisco Nexus 7700 Series Switches.

CWE-196	The software uses an unsigned primitive and performs a cast to a signed primitive， which can produce an unexpected value if the value of the unsigned primitive can not be represented using a signed primitive. Although less frequent an issue than signed-to-unsigned conversion， unsigned-to-signed conversion can be the perfect precursor to dangerous buffer underwrite conditions that allow attackers to move down the stack where they otherwise might not have access in a normal buffer overflow condition. Buffer underwrites occur frequently when large unsigned values are cast to signed values， and then used as indexes into a buffer or for pointer arithmetic.<PlainLiteral>

CAPEC-307	An adversary scans for RPC services listing on a Unix/Linux host. This type of scan can be obtained via native operating system utilities or via port scanners like nmap. When performed by a scanner， an RPC datagram is sent to a list of UDP ports and the response is recorded. Particular types of responses can be indicative of well-known RPC services running on a UDP port. Direct RPC scans that bypass portmapper/sunrpc are typically slow compare to other scan types， are easily detected by IPS/IDS systems， and can only detect open ports when an RPC service responds. ICMP diagnostic message responses can help identify closed ports， however filtered and unfiltered ports cannot be identified through TCP RPC scans. There are two general approaches to RPC scanning: One is to use a native operating system utility， or script， to query the portmapper/rpcbind application running on port 111. Portmapper will return a list of registered RPC services. Alternately， one can use a port scanner or script to scan for RPC services directly. Discovering RPC services gives the attacker potential targets to attack， as some RPC services are insecure by default.<PlainLiteral>

CWE-925	The Android application uses a Broadcast Receiver that receives an Intent but does not properly verify that the Intent came from an authorized source. Certain types of Intents， identified by action string， can only be broadcast by the operating system itself， not by third-party applications. However， when an application registers to receive these implicit system intents， it is also registered to receive any explicit intents. While a malicious application cannot send an implicit system intent， it can send an explicit intent to the target application， which may assume that any received intent is a valid implicit system intent and not an explicit intent from another application. This may lead to unintended behavior.<PlainLiteral>
CWE-301	Simple authentication protocols are subject to reflection attacks if a malicious user can use the target machine to impersonate a trusted user. A mutual authentication protocol requires each party to respond to a random challenge by the other party by encrypting it with a pre-shared key.

CVE-2019-2818	Vulnerability in the Java SE component of Oracle Java SE (subcomponent: Security). Supported versions that are affected are Java SE: 11.0.3 and 12.0.1. Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise Java SE. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized read access to a subset of Java SE accessible data. Note: This vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets (in Java SE 8), that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability does not apply to Java deployments, typically in servers, that load and run only trusted code (e.g., code installed by an administrator).

CVE-2019-11730	A vulnerability exists where if a user opens a locally saved HTML file, this file can use file: URIs to access other files in the same directory or sub-directories if the names are known or guessed. The Fetch API can then be used to read the contents of any files stored in these directories and they may uploaded to a server. It was demonstrated that in combination with a popular Android messaging app, if a malicious HTML attachment is sent to a user and they opened that attachment in Firefox, due to that app's predictable pattern for locally-saved file names, it is possible to read attachments the victim received from other correspondents. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 60.8, Firefox < 68, and Thunderbird < 60.8.

CVE-2017-8333	An issue was discovered on Securifi Almond, Almond+, and Almond 2015 devices with firmware AL-R096. The device provides a user with the capability of adding new routes to the device. It seems that the POST parameters passed in this request to set up routes on the device can be set in such a way that would result in passing commands to a "popen" API in the function and thus result in command injection on the device. If the firmware version AL-R096 is dissected using binwalk tool, we obtain a cpio-root archive which contains the filesystem set up on the device that contains all the binaries. The binary "goahead" is the one that has the vulnerable function that receives the values sent by the POST request. If we open this binary in IDA-pro we will notice that this follows a MIPS little endian format. The function sub_00420F38 in IDA pro is identified to be receiving the values sent in the POST request and the value set in POST parameter "dest" is extracted at address 0x00420FC4. The POST parameter "dest is concatenated in a route add command and this is passed to a "popen" function at address 0x00421220. This allows an attacker to provide the payload of his/her choice and finally take control of the device.

CVE-2019-11516	An issue was discovered in the Bluetooth component of the Cypress (formerly owned by Broadcom) Wireless IoT codebase. Extended Inquiry Responses (EIRs) are improperly handled, which causes a heap-based buffer overflow during device inquiry. This overflow can be used to overwrite existing functions with arbitrary code. The Reserved for Future Use (RFU) bits are not discarded by eir_handleRx(), and are included in an EIR's length. Therefore, one can exceed the expected 240 bytes, which leads to a heap-based buffer overflow in eir_getReceivedEIR() called by bthci_event_SendInquiryResultEvent(). In order to exploit this bug, an attacker must repeatedly connect to the victim's device in a short amount of time from different source addresses. This will cause the victim's Bluetooth stack to resolve the device names and therefore allocate buffers with attacker-controlled data. Due to the heap corruption, the name will be eventually written to an attacker-controlled location, leading to a write-what-where condition.
CVE-2017-10720	Recently it was discovered as a part of the research on IoT devices in the most recent firmware for Shekar Endoscope that the desktop application used to connect to the device suffers from a stack overflow if more than 26 characters are passed to it as the Wi-Fi name. This application is installed on the device and an attacker who can provide the right payload can execute code on the user's system directly. Any breach of this system can allow an attacker to get access to all the data that the user has access too. The application uses a dynamic link library(DLL) called "avilib.dll" which is used by the application to send binary packets to the device that allow to control the device. One such action that the DLL provides is change password in the function "sendchangename" which allows a user to change the Wi-Fi name on the device. This function calls a sub function "sub_75876EA0" at address 0x758784F8. The function determines which action to execute based on the parameters sent to it. The "sendchangename" passes the datastring as the second argument which is the name we enter in the textbox and integer 1 as first argument. The rest of the 3 arguments are set to 0. The function "sub_75876EA0" at address 0x75876F19 uses the first argument received and to determine which block to jump to. Since the argument passed is 1, it jumps to 0x75876F20 and proceeds from there to address 0x75876F56 which calculates the length of the data string passed as the first parameter. This length and the first argument are then passed to the address 0x75877001 which calls the memmove function which uses a stack address as the destination where the password typed by us is passed as the source and length calculated above is passed as the number of bytes to copy which leads to a stack overflow.
CVE-2011-1824	The VEGAOpBitmap::AddLine function in Opera before 10.61 does not properly initialize memory during processing of the SIZE attribute of a SELECT element, which allows remote attackers to trigger an invalid memory write operation, and consequently cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code, via a large integer attribute value.

CAPEC-19	An attack of this type exploits a programs' vulnerabilities that are brought on by allowing remote hosts to execute scripts. The adversary leverages this capability to execute his/her own script by embedding it within other scripts that the target software is likely to execute. The adversary must have the ability to inject their script into a script that is likely to be executed. If this is done， then the adversary can potentially launch a variety of probes and attacks against the web server's local environment， in many cases the so-called DMZ， back end resources the web server can communicate with， and other hosts. With the proliferation of intermediaries， such as Web App Firewalls， network devices， and even printers having JVMs and Web servers， there are many locales where an attacker can inject malicious scripts. Since this attack pattern defines scripts within scripts， there are likely privileges to execute said attack on the host. These attacks are not solely limited to the server side， client side scripts like Ajax and client side JavaScript can contain malicious scripts as well.<PlainLiteral>

CVE-2017-9387	An issue was discovered on Vera VeraEdge 1.7.19 and Veralite 1.7.481 devices. The device provides a shell script called relay.sh which is used for creating new SSH relays for the device so that the device connects to Vera servers. All the parameters passed in this specific script are logged to a log file called log.relay in the /tmp folder. The user can also read all the log files from the device using a script called log.sh. However, when the script loads the log files it displays them with content-type text/html and passes all the logs through the ansi2html binary which converts all the character text including HTML meta-characters correctly to be displayed in the browser. This allows an attacker to use the log files as a storing mechanism for the XSS payload and thus whenever a user navigates to that log.sh script, it enables the XSS payload and allows an attacker to execute his malicious payload on the user's browser.

CVE-2017-8415	An issue was discovered on D-Link DCS-1100 and DCS-1130 devices. The device has a custom telnet daemon as a part of the busybox and retrieves the password from the shadow file using the function getspnam at address 0x00053894. Then performs a crypt operation on the password retrieved from the user at address 0x000538E0 and performs a strcmp at address 0x00053908 to check if the password is correct or incorrect. However, the /etc/shadow file is a part of CRAM-FS filesystem which means that the user cannot change the password and hence a hardcoded hash in /etc/shadow is used to match the credentials provided by the user. This is a salted hash of the string "admin" and hence it acts as a password to the device which cannot be changed as the whole filesystem is read only.

CVE-2019-9858	Remote code execution was discovered in Horde Groupware Webmail 5.2.22 and 5.2.17. Horde/Form/Type.php contains a vulnerable class that handles image upload in forms. When the Horde_Form_Type_image method onSubmit() is called on uploads, it invokes the functions getImage() and _getUpload(), which uses unsanitized user input as a path to save the image. The unsanitized POST parameter object[photo][img][file] is saved in the $upload[img][file] PHP variable, allowing an attacker to manipulate the $tmp_file passed to move_uploaded_file() to save the uploaded file. By setting the parameter to (for example) ../usr/share/horde/static/bd.php, one can write a PHP backdoor inside the web root. The static/ destination folder is a good candidate to drop the backdoor because it is always writable in Horde installations. (The unsanitized POST parameter went probably unnoticed because it's never submitted by the forms, which default to securely using a random path.)

Care was taken to programmatically disable potentially dangerous openvpn parameters; however, the --route-pre-down parameter can be used. This parameter accepts an arbitrary path to a script/program to be executed when OpenVPN exits. The --script-security parameter also needs to be passed to allow for this action to be taken, and --script-security is not currently in the disabled parameter list. A local unprivileged user can pass a malicious script/binary to the --route-pre-down option, which will be executed as root when openvpn is stopped.

CVE-2017-9391	An issue was discovered on Vera VeraEdge 1.7.19 and Veralite 1.7.481 devices. The device provides UPnP services that are available on port 3480 and can also be accessed via port 80 using the url "/port_3480". It seems that the UPnP services provide "request_image" as one of the service actions for a normal user to retrieve an image from a camera that is controlled by the controller. It seems that the "URL" parameter passed in the query string is not sanitized and is stored on the stack which allows an attacker to overflow the buffer. The function "LU::Generic_IP_Camera_Manager::REQ_Image" is activated when the lu_request_image is passed as the "id" parameter in query string. This function then calls "LU::Generic_IP_Camera_Manager::GetUrlFromArguments" and passes a "pointer" to the function where it will be allowed to store the value from the URL parameter. This pointer is passed as the second parameter $a2 to the function "LU::Generic_IP_Camera_Manager::GetUrlFromArguments". However, neither the callee or the caller in this case performs a simple length check and as a result an attacker who is able to send more than 1336 characters can easily overflow the values stored on the stack including the $RA value and thus execute code on the device.

If the application uses external inputs to determine which class to instantiate or which method to invoke， then an attacker could supply values to select unexpected classes or methods. If this occurs， then the attacker could create control flow paths that were not intended by the developer. These paths could bypass authentication or access control checks， or otherwise cause the application to behave in an unexpected manner. This situation becomes a doomsday scenario if the attacker can upload files into a location that appears on the application's classpath (CWE-427) or add new entries to the application's classpath (CWE-426). Under either of these conditions， the attacker can use reflection to introduce new， malicious behavior into the application.<PlainLiteral>
